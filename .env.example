### elizaOS Environment Variables ###
# To get started, copy this file to .env, or make a .env and add the settings you'd like to override
# Please read the comments for each of the configurations

# The only thing you ABSOLUTELY NEED to get up and running is one of the model provider keys, i.e. OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or setup the local-ai plugin
# Everything else is optional, and most settings and secrets can be configured in your agent or through the GUI
# For multi-agent, each agent will need keys for the various services it is connected to
# You can use the .env or environment variables generally for shared keys, such as to model providers, database, etc, with scoped keys for services such as Telegram, Discord, etc

### MODEL PRODIVER KEYS ###
# Eliza is compatible with a wide array of model providers. Many have OpenAI compatible APIs, and you can use them by overriding the base URL

# NOTE: You will need a provider that provides embeddings. So even if you use Claude, you will need to get embeddings using another provider, for example openai or our local-ai plugin

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Use this to override the openai endpoint, for example for using together.ai, fireworks or other providers
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=

# Anthropic Configuration

# By default in most of our starter kits, Anthropic will take precedence over OpenAI in handling requests
# Anthropic does not handle embeddings, so you may wish to use OpenAI for that, even while Claude is handling text generation

### DATABASE ###
# By default, Eliza will use a local pglite instance
# If you fill out POSTGRES_URL, the agent will connect to your postgres instance instead of using the local path

# You can override the pglite data directory
# PGLITE_DATA_DIR=/Users/UserName/eliza/packages/.pglite/

# Fill this out if you want to use Postgres

### SINGLE AGENT VARIABLES ###
# If you are running multiple agents, you will need to configure these variables in the agent secrets (available in the GUI)
# OR you can namespace the secrets and connect them up in your character definition

# Example: 
# settings: {
#   process.env.COMMUNITY_MANAGER_DISCORD_API_TOKEN
# }

# Note: See below for multi-agent examples

# Fill these out if you want to use Discord
