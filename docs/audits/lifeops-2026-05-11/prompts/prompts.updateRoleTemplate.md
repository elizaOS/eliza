## Current text
```
task: Extract the requested role change.

context:
{{providers}}

current_roles:
{{roles}}

recent_messages:
{{recentMessages}}

current_message:
{{message}}

instructions[6]:
- identify single entity whose role changes
- entity_id only when UUID is explicit in context
- normalize new_role to OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER, GUEST, or NONE
- if removing elevated access without naming a new role, use NONE
- do not invent entity ids or roles
- include short thought describing the change

output:
JSON only. One JSON object. No prose, no <think>.

Example:
thought: Sarah should become an admin.
entity_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
new_role: ADMIN

JSON only. Return one JSON object. No prose, fences, thinking, or markdown.
