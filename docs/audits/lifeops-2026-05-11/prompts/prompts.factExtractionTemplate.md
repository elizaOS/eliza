# Task: Classify and extract facts from this message

You maintain two fact stores. Decide what to insert, strengthen, decay, or contradict. Return JSON ops only.

Stores:
- durable: stable identity-level claims that matter in a year.
  Categories: identity, health, relationship, life_event, business_role, preference, goal.
- current: time-bound state about now or near term.
  Categories: feeling, physical_state, working_on, going_through, schedule_context.

Rules:
- If a claim feels stale or surprising to retrieve in a year, use current.
- Empty output is right for small talk or claim-free questions.
- Before add_durable/add_current, scan known facts. If meaning exists, emit strengthen with that factId.
- Paraphrases count as duplicates. Match meaning, not surface form.

Ops:
- add_durable: claim, category, structured_fields, keywords; optional verification_status, reason.
- add_current: claim, category, structured_fields, keywords; optional valid_at, reason.
- strengthen: factId, optional reason.
- decay: factId, optional reason.
- contradict: factId, reason, optional proposedText.

For add_durable/add_current, include keywords: 3-8 lowercase retrieval terms.
Use canonical nouns, proper names, symptoms, places, projects, dates, and
preferences. Omit stopwords and generic words.

Examples:

## Usage stats (latest trajectories)
- Invocations: 0 (this prompt was not matched in any recent trajectory)

## Sample failure transcripts
None.

## Suggested edits (heuristic)
- Repeated phrase: `claim, category, structured_fields, keywords; optional` — appears more than once; consider deduping for token savings.

## Actions
- Accept a candidate rewrite: `bun run lifeops:prompt-accept -- --id <id> --from <candidate-file>`
- Freeze (skip future optimization): `bun run lifeops:prompt-freeze -- --id <id>`
