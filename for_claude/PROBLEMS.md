the program successfully launches the tommy trojan ai agent and I can interact with him in the front end interface. However, tommy trojan will only tweet when he is instructed to in the front end interface. Tommy should autonomously post on twitter without any intervention. Additionally, when the program is started, tommy should tweet immediately. It seems like currently, the post to twitter function call is only taking place when the agent is prompted to in the front end chat interface. 

here are the problems i need fixed

1. the tommy trojan ai agent should post immediately upon the start of the program without human intervention. i believe this requires changing the logic around when the post_tweet action is used.
