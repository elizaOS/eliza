```bash
bun install
bun run build # npm will work too
bun start # npm will work too
```

### Interact via Browser

Once the agent is running, visit https://localhost:3000 to interact with your agent through a web interface.

No separate client startup is needed for basic interaction in the newer versions.

If you are using the core monorepo for development, you may need a separate client:

```bash
bun start:client
```

Then read the [Documentation](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/) to learn how to customize your Eliza.

### Automatically Start Eliza

For a more automated setup:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:elizaOS/eliza.git
cd eliza

# Run the start script with verbose logging
./scripts/start.sh -v
```

The start script handles all dependencies, environment setup, and character management automatically.

---

### Modify Character

1. Open `packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to modify the default character. Uncomment and edit.

2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `bun start`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
