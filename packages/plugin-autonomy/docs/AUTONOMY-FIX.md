# Autonomous Loop Self-Message Fix

## Problem

The autonomous loop was creating messages with the agent's own ID as the `entityId`, which caused the message-handling plugin to reject them with the error:

```
error: Message is from the agent itself
```

This prevented the autonomous loop from functioning properly.

## Solution

The fix involves using a system entity ID instead of the agent's own ID for autonomous messages:

1. **Create a System Entity ID**: In the `AutonomousLoopService` constructor, we create a consistent system entity ID:
   ```typescript
   this.systemEntityId = asUUID(uuidv4().replace(/-/g, '').slice(0, 8) + '-system-autonomy-loop');
   ```

2. **Use System Entity ID for Messages**: When creating autonomous messages, use the system entity ID instead of the agent ID:
   ```typescript
   const autonomousMessage: Memory = {
     id: asUUID(uuidv4()),
     entityId: this.systemEntityId, // Use system entity ID instead of agent ID
     roomId: this.roomId,
     content: {
       text: 'What should I do next? Think about your goals and take appropriate actions.',
       thought: 'Autonomous loop iteration - time to think and act',
       source: 'autonomy-system', // Mark as coming from autonomy system
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Process with Callback**: The message is processed with a proper callback that logs the result:
   ```typescript
   await this.runtime.processMessage(autonomousMessage, async (content: Content) => {
     console.log('[AutonomousLoop] Message processed:', content.text?.substring(0, 100) + '...');
     // Emit log with the response
     return Promise.resolve([]); // Return empty array
   });
   ```

## Result

After implementing this fix:
- ✅ No more "Message is from the agent itself" errors
- ✅ Autonomous loop executes successfully every configured interval
- ✅ Messages are processed normally through the runtime
- ✅ The agent can respond to autonomous prompts and take actions

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Enable autonomy:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/autonomy/enable
   ```

2. Check the logs - you should see:
   - "Executing autonomous loop iteration"
   - "Autonomous loop iteration completed"
   - NO "Message is from the agent itself" errors

3. The agent will process autonomous thoughts and potentially take actions based on its goals and current state.
