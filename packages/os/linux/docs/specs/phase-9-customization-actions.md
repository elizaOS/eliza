# Phase 9 — Customization chat actions

"Install i3", "switch to tiling", "swipe-down for notifications", "dark
theme" — all through chat, the bundled elizaOS app orchestrating Linux
underneath. Each action should live in the app/runtime packages that are
actually bundled into the ISO. **Persistence-aware**: customizations only
stick in persistent mode.

## Established pattern
An `Action` is `{ name, similes[], description, validate, handler,
examples }`. `validate` returns a bool from a text matcher; `handler`
calls `callback({ text, actions:[NAME] })` and returns `{ success, text,
data }`. System boundaries (spawn, apt) are injected via `options` so
tests don't shell out. Multi-turn work uses a flow + dispatcher route.
Actions register in the bundled runtime plugin/action registry.

## What already exists — do NOT duplicate
- **`SET_WALLPAPER`** (`actions/wallpaper.ts`) — THEME must not touch wallpaper.
- **`INSTALL_PACKAGE`** + `install-package-flow.ts` + `install-package-runner.ts`
  — chat-driven `apt-get install` *with a confirmation flow*, package-name
  validation, curated `PACKAGE_GROUPS` (`i3 desktop` → `[i3, i3status,
  i3lock, dmenu, xterm]`, etc.), `DANGEROUS_PACKAGES` blocklist. **This is
  the SHELL substrate** — it already does the apt install.
- **`OPEN_TERMINAL`** — the "drop me into a shell" escape hatch.
- **`SETUP_PERSISTENCE`** + `persistence-flow.ts` — Phase 9 actions *read*
  persistence state, they don't manage it.

So: **SHELL is a thin gating layer over the existing `INSTALL_PACKAGE`
substrate; SET_DESKTOP / THEME / NOTIFICATIONS are genuinely new actions.**

## Shared prerequisite: runtime customization helper
Exports `persistenceState(): "persistent" | "amnesia"` (reads a marker the
live system knows). Every Phase 9 handler calls it and appends a
persistence-aware sentence: persistent → "this'll stick after reboot";
amnesia → "heads up — resets to defaults next boot; say 'set up
persistence' to make it stick." Implements the PLAN "persistence-aware"
requirement once.

## Action 1 — SHELL (superseded security note)

The earlier passwordless sudo/polkit direction below is not accepted for the
current product security model. Production must route privileged package,
service, network, and device operations through the elizaOS capability broker
with named commands, exact argument schemas, user approval or enterprise
policy, and audit events. Do not add passwordless `apt-get` sudoers for the
desktop user.

## Action 1 — SHELL (legacy sketch, not accepted as-is)
**File:** app/runtime action module for `SHELL`.
`validate` **defers to `INSTALL_PACKAGE`** when install intent is present
(returns false) so package installs keep going through the confirmation
flow; SHELL handles the *non-install* privileged commands ("update the
package list", "remove i3", "enable bluetooth service"). `validate`
matches a curated verb→command-template allowlist (not free-form shell —
charset-validated args, array-spawn, no shell metacharacters). `handler`
shells via an injectable `spawnFn`.

This sketch is useful only as app-side intent parsing. The privileged
execution half is superseded by the capability-broker policy above.

**Rejected legacy polkit/sudoers direction** (do not implement without a new
approved broker policy):
- `TAILS/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/org.elizaos.shell.rules`
  — grants the desktop user `Result.YES` for the relevant systemd /
  packagekit actions (pattern from Tails' `org.boum.tails.additional-software.rules`).
- `TAILS/config/chroot_local-includes/etc/generate-sudoers.d/elizaos-shell.toml`
  — a `[[commands]]` block (pattern from `tps.toml`) granting the desktop
  user `NOPASSWD` on `/usr/bin/apt-get` + a wrapper with a fixed arg
  allowlist. This makes the agent's existing `sudo apt-get` passwordless.

## Action 2 — SET_DESKTOP
**File:** app/runtime action module for `SET_DESKTOP`. similes
`switch to i3`, `use sway`, `tiling desktop`, etc. `validate` matches
verb + a known-WM token. **Composes** `INSTALL_PACKAGE`: if the WM's
packages aren't installed, hands off to `beginInstallPackageFlow()`, then
on the follow-up turn writes session config. System surface: writes
`~/.dmrc` / an AccountsService user-session key naming the `.desktop`
session file in `/usr/share/xsessions/` or `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/`
— additive, never modifies Tails' GDM hooks.

## Action 3 — THEME
**File:** app/runtime action module for `THEME`. similes `dark
theme`, `make it dark`, etc. Distinct from `SET_WALLPAPER` — THEME is GTK
theme + dotfiles, no image generation. `handler` writes `gsettings set
org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme/color-scheme` and/or
`~/.config/gtk-{3,4}.0/settings.ini`. Curated theme set should preserve the
current blue/white elizaOS theme and may add optional dark variants later. Writes to
`~/.config/elizaos/` (already in Phase 7's persistence dir list).

## Action 4 — NOTIFICATIONS
**File:** app/runtime action module for `NOTIFICATIONS`. similes
`swipe down for notifications`, `android-style notifications`, `install
swaync`, etc. Like SET_DESKTOP, **composes** `install-package-flow` if
`swaync`/the GNOME shell extension isn't installed, then writes config
(`~/.config/swaync/config.json`, or `gnome-extensions enable`).

## Plugin registration
- Add all 4 to the bundled runtime action registry.
- SET_DESKTOP + NOTIFICATIONS reuse the existing `install-package-flow`
  for the multi-turn install handoff — no new flow files.
- Update `HELP_ACTION` reply text in `actions/system.ts`.

## Documentation
New file `./docs/customization-vocabulary.md` — the
full chat command set (every simile for the 4 actions, the WM/theme/
notification options) + the "amnesia vs persistent" note.

## Ordered implementation checklist
1. Runtime customization helper — `persistenceState()` + the reply helper.
2. Define broker-backed privileged commands with exact schemas, approval
   prompts, audit events, and tests; do not add passwordless apt sudoers.
3. `actions/shell.ts` — defers to `INSTALL_PACKAGE` on install intent and
   calls only approved broker commands for privileged work.
4. `actions/set-desktop.ts` — composes `install-package-flow`, writes `~/.dmrc` additively.
5. `actions/theme.ts` — GTK theme + `~/.config/gtk-*` / `~/.config/elizaos/`.
6. `actions/notifications.ts` — composes `install-package-flow`, writes notification config.
7. Register all 4 in `plugin.ts`; update `HELP_ACTION`.
8. Unit tests in the owning runtime package (inject fake `spawnFn`, assert no shell-out, assert persistence-aware reply branches).
9. Write `docs/customization-vocabulary.md`.
