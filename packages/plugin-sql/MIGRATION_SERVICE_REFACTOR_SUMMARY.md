# Migration Service Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully refactored the `runPluginMigrations` function into a proper service-based architecture that follows ElizaOS patterns. The new architecture provides better separation of concerns, extensibility, and follows the established service patterns.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Types and Interfaces

#### Migration Types (`packages/core/src/types/migration.ts`)
- **IMigrationService**: Core interface for all migration services
- **MigrationHistory**: Track migration execution history
- **MigrationConfig**: Configuration options for migrations
- **MigrationStep**: Individual migration step definition
- **PluginMigration**: Plugin-specific migration metadata

Added `MIGRATION` to the `ServiceTypeRegistry` via module augmentation.

### 2. Base Classes

#### MigrationService (`packages/core/src/services/migration-service.ts`)
- Abstract base class implementing `IMigrationService`
- Provides common functionality:
  - Schema registration
  - Migration history tracking
  - Success/failure recording
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Plugin schema discovery

#### PluginMigrationService (`packages/core/src/services/plugin-migration-service.ts`)
- Abstract base for plugin-specific migrations
- Handles version comparison and migration steps
- Supports rollback operations
- Manages plugin-specific migration lifecycle

### 3. SQL Plugin Migration Service

#### DatabaseMigrationService (`packages/plugin-sql/src/services/database-migration-service.ts`)
- Extends `MigrationService`
- Manages database schema migrations
- Features:
  - Migration history table creation and management
  - Plugin schema discovery and registration
  - Version tracking in database
  - Cross-database support (PostgreSQL/PGLite)
  - Integration with existing `runPluginMigrations`

### 4. Migration Orchestrator

#### MigrationOrchestrator (`packages/core/src/services/migration-orchestrator.ts`)
- Coordinates execution of all migration services
- Features:
  - Service discovery via `runtime.getServicesByType()`
  - Priority-based execution (database migrations first)
  - Aggregated migration history
  - Migration status checking
  - Error handling and reporting

### 5. Integration Updates

#### Plugin Registration (`packages/plugin-sql/src/index.ts`)
```typescript
export const plugin: Plugin = {
  name: '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
  services: [DatabaseMigrationService], // Now registered as a service
  // ...
};
```

#### Server Initialization (`packages/server/src/index.ts`)
- Creates a temporary runtime for migrations
- Uses `MigrationOrchestrator` to run all migrations
- Cleaner separation from server initialization logic

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Service Pattern Compliance**: Follows established ElizaOS service patterns
2. **Extensibility**: Plugins can provide their own migration services
3. **Better Organization**: Migration logic is properly encapsulated
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
5. **Migration History**: Built-in tracking of migration execution
6. **Rollback Support**: Framework for implementing rollbacks
7. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
8. **Multi-Database Support**: Works with both PostgreSQL and PGLite

## Usage Example

### For Plugin Developers

```typescript
// Custom plugin with migrations
class MyPluginMigrationService extends PluginMigrationService {
  static serviceName = 'my-plugin-migration' as ServiceTypeName;
  
  getTargetVersion(): string {
    return '1.0.0';
  }
  
  getMigrationSteps(fromVersion: string, toVersion: string): MigrationStep[] {
    return [
      {
        id: 'create-tables',
        description: 'Create plugin tables',
        up: async () => {
          // Migration logic
        },
        down: async () => {
          // Rollback logic
        }
      }
    ];
  }
}

export const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  services: [MyPluginMigrationService],
  // ...
};
```

### For Server/Runtime

```typescript
// Migrations run automatically when services are started
const orchestrator = new MigrationOrchestrator(runtime);
await orchestrator.runAllMigrations();
```

## Migration Flow

1. Server creates a temporary runtime with necessary plugins
2. Runtime initializes and starts all services (including migration services)
3. MigrationOrchestrator discovers all migration services via `getServicesByType()`
4. Orchestrator sorts services by priority (database migrations first)
5. Each migration service runs its migrations
6. History is tracked in the database
7. Success/failure is reported

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rollback Implementation**: Complete rollback support for database migrations
2. **Version Management**: More sophisticated version comparison
3. **Migration UI**: Web interface for viewing migration status
4. **Dry Run Mode**: Preview migrations without executing
5. **Migration Templates**: Generators for common migration patterns
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent migrations
7. **Migration Testing**: Automated testing framework for migrations

## Breaking Changes

None - the refactor maintains backward compatibility:
- `runPluginMigrations` still works as before
- `DatabaseMigrationService` is re-exported from the old location
- Server initialization continues to work with minor updates

## Conclusion

The migration service architecture now properly integrates with ElizaOS's service system, providing a clean, extensible, and maintainable solution for managing schema migrations across plugins.
