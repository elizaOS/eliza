# Autonomous Agent Features from Original Claude CLI

Based on the analysis of the 70k+ line bundled JavaScript file, here are the key autonomous agent features that made this CLI special:

## 1. CLAUDE.md System

The original CLI had a sophisticated system for project-specific instructions:

### Features:
- **`/init` command** - Automatically analyzes a codebase and creates a CLAUDE.md file
- **Multiple locations**:
  - `./CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - User-level instructions
  - `ULTRACLAUDE.md` - Extended instructions
- **Auto-memorization** - Shortcut to quickly add learnings to CLAUDE.md
- **External includes** - Can import instructions from outside the working directory
- **Automatic discovery** - Reads `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Implementation Pattern:
```javascript
var SE5 = {
  type: "prompt",
  name: "init",
  description: "Initialize a new CLAUDE.md file with codebase documentation",
  async getPromptForCommand() {
    return [{
      type: "text",
      text: `Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file...
      
      What to add:
      1. Commands that will be commonly used (build, lint, test)
      2. High-level code architecture and structure
      3. Big picture architecture requiring multiple files to understand`
    }]
  }
}
```

## 2. Tool Calling System

The CLI had an advanced tool-calling system with visual states:

### Tool States:
- `tool-input` - Gathering input for tool
- `tool-use` - Tool is being executed
- `responding` - Agent is responding
- `thinking` - Agent is thinking
- `requesting` - Agent is requesting permission

### Tool Permission System:
```javascript
// Permission handling
message: `Autocoder requested permissions to use ${toolName}...`

// Tool execution tracking
toolUseID: string
parentToolUseID: string
inProgressToolUseIDs: Set
erroredToolUseIDs: Set
resolvedToolUseIDs: Set
```

### Tool Types:
- File operations (read/write with permission)
- Shell commands
- Web search
- Git operations
- IDE integrations

## 3. Self-Looping & Autonomous Execution

The agent could autonomously:
- Plan multi-step operations
- Execute commands in sequence
- Handle errors and retry
- Learn from failures and update CLAUDE.md

### Key Patterns:
```javascript
// Autonomous planning
"Here is Autocoder's plan:"
// User can approve/reject/modify

// Self-correction
"No, and tell Autocoder what to do differently"

// Progress tracking
renderToolUseProgressMessage()
renderToolUseQueuedMessage()
```

## 4. Advanced Prompt System

### System Prompts:
```javascript
// Main agent prompt
`You are ${m0}, Anthropic's official CLI for Autocoder.`

// Tool-specific prompts
systemPrompt: [`Your task is to process Bash commands that an AI coding agent wants to run...`]

// Context-aware prompts
customSystemPrompt: string
appendSystemPrompt: string
```

### Dynamic Prompt Generation:
```javascript
async getPromptForCommand(context) {
  // Analyzes context
  // Includes relevant files
  // Adds CLAUDE.md instructions
  // Returns structured prompt
}
```

## 5. Memory & Learning

### Features:
- Session persistence
- Token usage tracking
- Cost estimation
- Learning from interactions
- Auto-updating CLAUDE.md with new patterns

### Memory Types:
- Project memory (CLAUDE.md)
- User memory (~/.claude/)
- Session memory (metrics, history)

## 6. IDE Integration

### Supported IDEs:
- VS Code
- Cursor
- JetBrains
- Zed

### Features:
- Direct file diff application
- @File references
- Real-time sync

## 7. Permission Management

### Granular Permissions:
- File read/write
- Command execution
- External URL fetching
- Settings modification

### Permission Modes:
- Ask every time
- Allow for session
- Remember permanently

## 8. Error Recovery

### Smart Error Handling:
- Retry with different approach
- Ask for clarification
- Suggest alternatives
- Update memory to avoid future errors

## Implementation Ideas

To recreate these features in our reconstructed CLI:

1. **CLAUDE.md System**
   - Add `/init` command
   - Implement file discovery
   - Create memorization shortcuts

2. **Enhanced Tool System**
   - Add permission framework
   - Implement tool queue
   - Create progress indicators

3. **Autonomous Planning**
   - Multi-step execution plans
   - User approval workflows
   - Self-correction mechanisms

4. **Dynamic Prompts**
   - Context-aware prompt building
   - Project-specific instructions
   - Learning from interactions

5. **Session Persistence**
   - Extend current session system
   - Add learning capabilities
   - Implement CLAUDE.md updates
