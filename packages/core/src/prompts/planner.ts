/**
 * Prompt template and output JSON schema for the planner, which turns the user
 * request and prior tool results into the smallest grounded queue of native
 * tool calls (or a user-visible message when no tool fits). Feeds the
 * planner-loop stage of the message loop. The schema keeps `args` a permissive
 * object — strict-grammar providers reject an empty `properties` shape — and
 * carries an optional `completed` signal the post-tool gate uses to decide
 * whether to fall through to a full evaluator pass. Native function-calling
 * envelopes cannot carry that top-level field, so every exposed tool schema
 * additionally accepts the reserved `eliza_turn_scope` argument (#17034),
 * which the loop folds into the same completion signal and strips before
 * dispatch.

	'"final" means all requested actions are in this queue; their results need not be known yet. The evaluator verifies results and composes the answer. "more_work_pending" means these results must ground a later action (e.g. read an ID before updating). Queued actions, recalling prior dialogue, and writing the final answer do not require another batch. Use final for a read whose result only needs reporting or combining with known conversation details. Use more_work_pending only when a concrete additional operation must be chosen from the returned evidence, not because the evaluator still needs to answer.';

The JSON inside [FORM] is form data, not a tool attempt; keep JSON inside the marker and do not emit unrelated JSON.",

		"- messageToUser must read like natural conversation, not a database or debug log. Prefer concise everyday wording. Translate machine dates, 24-hour times, and Unix/epoch timestamps into familiar dates and times; do not expose internal ids, field names, raw JSON, tool names, receipt metadata, or backend jargon unless the user explicitly asks for raw or technical output. Preserve exact code and user-provided values when they are the subject of the request.",
	recallTools:
		"- SHELL is for filesystem/process work, not a fallback for chat-message search/recall, memory queries, or agent-history lookups. Use the dedicated authorized search action (e.g. SEARCH_MESSAGES, MESSAGE_SEARCH, MEMORY_SEARCH); if absent, check DISCOVER_TOOLS when exposed before reporting unavailability. Never substitute shell greps, placeholder echoes or simulated searches.",
	discovery:
		"- candidateActions are retrieval hints, not executable capabilities. If a hinted name is absent, scan exposed tools and, when available, DISCOVER_TOOLS for an authorized operation covering the intent (e.g. TASKS_MANAGE_ISSUES instead of GITHUB_LIST_ISSUES, TRIGGER_CREATE instead of OWNER_REMINDERS). Continue after discovery with the loaded tool; discovery itself does no domain work. Respect any admission denial. Only report unavailable after the available discovery path cannot supply a fitting tool. Never invent SHELL/BROWSER/TASKS workarounds or echo commands to trigger missing capabilities; placeholder echoes burn cost and produce no progress.",
	codingDelegation:
		"- TASKS_SPAWN_AGENT delegates coding/build/repo work: file edits, shell tooling, apps, tests, deployments and PRs. It is not a fallback for chat-message recall, memory queries or agent-history lookups; use their dedicated authorized search tools or discovery, then report an actual limitation if unavailable. Do not spawn a coding agent to search a chat channel.",

This covers every tense, implied claim and subjectless progress phrase ("Searching...", "Working on it", "Almost done"), including promised future replies. The planner stops after returning; no further work runs without a new user message. If iterations end without usable results, state the actual attempted search/fetch and its outcome plainly; never promise an ongoing search or task that is not running.',
	errorClaims:
		"- messageToUser and REPLY text must NEVER fabricate a failure, error, or interruption that did not actually occur this turn. A real tool error or empty result is required before reporting a glitch, failure, interruption or asking the user to retry.

This applies regardless of wording; never invent a stall-and-retry excuse.",

export const plannerTemplate = `task: Plan next native tool calls.

rules:
- use only tools array; smallest grounded queue that covers every explicit requested outcome, including navigation separately from reading, searching, or changing data. Opening a visible browser/view and researching a question are separate outcomes: a background web search does not open the user's browser. Queue both when both are requested; do not demote navigation to an optional detail of the "main" task. Routing hints are not a replacement for the full user request; do not silently drop a clause.
- routed action: set parameters.action only if schema has it
- args grounded in user request or prior tool results
- obey schema; arrays as JSON arrays, not comma strings
- no empty strings/placeholders/invented required args; gather via grounded tool or no tool
- matching tool exists => call it, even missing details; handler owns questions/drafts/confirm/refusal
- Owner life-management side effects (calendar events, reminders, alarms, todos, routines, goals, scheduled/recurring tasks) MUST call the matching exposed life-management/scheduling tool before any terminal answer — match by the exposed tools' names, routing hints, and descriptions (e.g. CALENDAR for calendar work; OWNER_REMINDERS, SCHEDULED_TASKS, or TRIGGER_CREATE for reminders/scheduling — whichever is exposed this turn). Never declare the capability missing because a specific name above is absent: if any exposed tool's hint/description covers the intent, that tool IS the capability — call it. A tool-owned conflict, clarification, preview, confirmation request, or fail-closed no-op is still a tool result, not bare messageToUser.
- no messageToUser follow-up when matching tool exists
${plannerRequiredPolicy.sideEffects}
${plannerRequiredPolicy.completedEffects}
- messageToUser is user-visible only; no thoughts, analysis, tool names, function syntax, arbitrary JSON/tool attempts, "call MESSAGE"
${plannerRequiredPolicy.responseStyle}
- native toolCalls: pass each argument as a direct field in that tool's args object exactly as its schema declares; never nest arguments under \`parameters\` unless the tool schema itself declares a \`parameters\` field
- plain-JSON fallback only (when native tool calls are unavailable): return exactly {"action":"TOOL_NAME","parameters":{...},"thought":"short reason"}; never put that envelope inside a native tool's args
- owner goal save/create/update/review when OWNER_GOALS is exposed => native OWNER_GOALS args are {"action":"create|update|review","intent":"...","title":"...","confirmed":true|false,"details":{"description":"...","successCriteria":{"summary":"..."},"supportStrategy":{"summary":"..."} } }; only the plain-JSON fallback wraps those args in {"action":"OWNER_GOALS","parameters":{...},"thought":"..."}; never use messageToUser
${plannerRequiredPolicy.widgets}
- more tool work => native toolCalls only; never narrate/simulate calls
- partial after tool result => next grounded tool, not messageToUser
- tool-required router decision => run at least one exposed non-terminal tool before terminal answer
- incomplete while user needs live/current/external data, filesystem/runtime state, command output, repo work, build, PR, deploy, verify, side effect, and exposed tool can try
- attachments/memory/snippets do not replace explicit current run/check/fetch/inspect/build/deploy/verify/look up now; call tool
- exposed tool can try => call it; do not say "I cannot browse/search/run/inspect/build/deploy/verify"
${plannerRequiredPolicy.recallTools}
${plannerRequiredPolicy.discovery}
${plannerRequiredPolicy.codingDelegation}
- A one-shot live/current/public-data lookup — current price, weather, score, news headline, a status, or a value at a known URL — is NOT coding work: call WEB_FETCH (construct the single URL yourself) or WEB_SEARCH directly and answer from the result. Do NOT spawn a coding sub-agent for it: a sub-agent for a single lookup is slow, frequently re-spawns itself, and posts spurious "working on it" progress acks before answering. Spawn only when the task is genuinely build/code/repo/multi-step work.
- no authorized tool fits after available discovery, or task complete => no toolCalls, set messageToUser
- Batch scope: ${plannerBatchScopeDescription}
- native toolCalls: every tool requires the reserved arg \`eliza_turn_scope\` (stripped before execution); use the same batch scope on every call. In plain-JSON fallback, completed=true means "final", completed=false means "more_work_pending"; omit only when unknown. Neither form skips result verification.
${plannerRequiredPolicy.workClaims}
${plannerRequiredPolicy.errorClaims}
- When a tool call produced actual output (stdout, fetched content, search results, file listings, command output), the subsequent messageToUser must include that output directly — do not replace it with a meta-summary of what the tool did. Phrases like "Listed files as requested", "Provided the output as returned by X", "Returned the result", "Executed the command", "Searched and found results", or "Gathered the information" are meta-narration, not answers. If the tool already returned user-friendly text (verifiedUserFacing is true), prefer that text as the user-visible surface; do not wrap it with a separate process-status bubble ("on it", "working on it", "got it") after the tool finished.
- Do not put a pre-tool progress or acknowledgement bubble in messageToUser when you also emit toolCalls this turn. messageToUser is not delivered before tools run; after a successful tool drains the queue the post-tool gate treats an explicit messageToUser as the terminal reply and can skip the evaluator, so a pre-tool ack ("I'm connecting your calendar", "searching now") can replace the real tool outcome. Prefer toolCalls alone for work-in-progress; set messageToUser only as a terminal answer when no further tool work is needed, or as a grounded post-tool outcome that includes the tool result.

If context has "# Routing hints", follow them. They are action routingHint metadata for this turn's exposed actions only.
