/**
 * Capacity derived from what a node actually is: RAM and CPU.
 *
 * Capacity was a slot counter stamped from one global env var, unrelated to the
 * machine, and it is wrong in both directions — both measured on the fleet on
 * 2026-08-12. It licensed 4 x 3072 MiB of ceilings onto 7745 MiB / 4 vCPU boxes
 * (the global OOM the admission gate closed), and it would hand a
 * 257626 MiB / 12 vCPU robot the blind default of 8.
 *
 * The dimensions disagree, which is why the minimum exists: the robot carries
 * ~21 GiB of RAM per core against the cloud box's ~1.9, so sizing it on memory
 * alone would over-subscribe its CPU roughly sevenfold. IO is absent on
 * purpose — it is transient and already enforced by the placement PSI gate.
 *
 * Deterministic and dependency-free: the decision is pure functions, so these
 * fixtures are the real hosts.
