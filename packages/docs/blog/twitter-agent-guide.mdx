# Setting Up Your Own Twitter Agent with ElizaOS

## Run your own AI agent on Twitter in minutes

Ever wanted your own AI assistant that can post and interact on Twitter (X)? With ElizaOS, you can set up a Twitter agent that posts content and interacts with other users automatically - no coding needed!

## Getting Started with ElizaOS

Setting up your Twitter agent is super easy! Let's walk through each step together.

### Step 1: Install the ElizaOS CLI

First, you'll need to install the ElizaOS Command Line Interface (CLI). This is like a special tool that helps you talk to ElizaOS.

Open your terminal (that black or white box where you type commands) and type:

```bash
npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta
```

Press Enter and wait for it to finish. This puts the ElizaOS tools on your computer so you can use them anytime!

### Step 2: Create a New Project

Now that you have the tools, let's make a new project:

```bash
elizaos create
```

A friendly wizard will appear and ask you some questions:

- Type a cool name for your project (like "my-twitter-bot")
- When it asks about database, select "pglite" (it's the easiest to set up)
- Follow the rest of the prompts

If you don't want to answer questions, you can also do:

```bash
elizaos create my-twitter-agent
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment Variables

Now we need to tell your agent how to connect to Twitter. We do this by setting up some secret information.

Open the special settings file in a text editor:

```bash
# We recommend using Cursor - the AI-powered code editor:
# 1. Download Cursor from https://cursor.sh
# 2. Open Cursor
# 3. Go to File > Open and navigate to:
#    - Windows: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.eliza\.env
#    - Mac/Linux: ~/.eliza/.env

# Alternatively, you can use:
# Windows: notepad C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.eliza\.env
# Mac: open -a TextEdit ~/.eliza/.env
# Linux: gedit ~/.eliza/.env
```

Add these lines to the file (but replace the example values with your own real information):

```
# Global environment variables for Eliza
PGLITE_DATA_DIR=~/.eliza/db

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Twitter Configuration
TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password
TWITTER_EMAIL=your_twitter_email
TWITTER_TARGET_USERS=user1,user2,user3
TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true
TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MIN=1
TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MAX=2
```

### Step 4: Start Your Project

Now for the exciting part! Navigate to your project folder and start it up:

```bash
# On Windows:
# 1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
# 2. Type: cd path\to\my-twitter-agent
# 3. Then type: elizaos start

# On Mac/Linux:
cd my-twitter-agent
elizaos start
```

Hooray! Your Twitter agent is now running! It will start posting and interacting based on the settings you chose.

## Customizing Your Twitter Agent's Personality

The most fun part is making your agent unique! You can change how it talks, what it posts about, and how it responds to others.

Open your project in a code editor:

```bash
# We recommend using Cursor - the AI-powered code editor:
# 1. Download Cursor from https://cursor.sh if you haven't already
# 2. Open Cursor
# 3. Go to File > Open Folder and select your project folder
# 4. In the file explorer panel, navigate to src/index.ts

# Cursor makes editing code much easier with AI assistance!
```

Look for the character definition section. It looks something like this:

```typescript
export const character: Character = {
  name: 'Eliza', // You can change this to any name you want!
  plugins: [
    // These are the special abilities your agent has
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-openai'] : []),
    ...(process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME ? ['@elizaos/plugin-twitter'] : []),
    // ... more plugins
  ],
  settings: {
    secrets: {},
  },
  system:
    'This is where you tell your agent how to behave on Twitter! For example: Be friendly and helpful, share interesting facts about technology, and respond to questions about AI.',
  bio: [
    'Make a list of personality traits here',
    'Each line is a different trait or behavior',
    'For example: Loves to share AI news',
    'Always responds with a friendly tone',
    'Includes a fun fact in every third tweet',
    'Never argues with other users',
  ],
  // There are more settings below you can customize too!
};
```

You can change anything in this file to make your agent behave differently:

1. **Name**: Change 'Eliza' to whatever you want to call your agent
2. **System**: This is the main instruction that guides how your agent acts
3. **Bio**: This list of traits helps shape your agent's personality

After making changes, save the file and restart your agent:

```bash
elizaos dev
```

## Advanced Usage

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can try these cool advanced features:

- **Custom Post Schedules**: Change when your agent posts by adjusting the `TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MIN` and `TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MAX` values
- **Topic Focus**: Edit the system prompt to focus on specific topics you care about
- **Interaction Styles**: Modify the bio to change how your agent interacts with others
- **Target Users**: Update `TWITTER_TARGET_USERS` to change who your agent interacts with

### Advanced: Server Deployment with Twitter Cookies

If you're deploying your Twitter agent to a server, you'll likely need to use Twitter cookies for authentication instead of just username/password. Here's how to set it up:

#### Finding Your Twitter Cookies for Server Deployment

Twitter's security measures can be stricter when logging in from a server location that differs from your usual location. Follow these steps:

1. **Important**: Try to access Twitter from the same location (IP address) as your server. If that's not possible, consider using a VPN that connects from a location near your server.

2. **Quick Cookie Extraction Steps**:

   - Log into Twitter in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Click the "Network" tab
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Click any twitter.com request in the list
   - Select the "Cookies" tab
   - Find and copy these three cookie values:
     - `auth_token`
     - `ct0`
     - `guest_id`

3. **Add to your .env file**:

```
# Twitter Cookies for Server Deployment
TWITTER_COOKIES_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWITTER_COOKIES_CT0=your_ct0_token_here
TWITTER_COOKIES_GUEST_ID=your_guest_id_here
```

That's it! Your server can now authenticate with Twitter using these cookies.

Happy tweeting!
