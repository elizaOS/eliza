# ElizaOS V2: What's New

The newest version of [eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) represents significant upgrades from the previous version, offering a leaner, more flexible architecture for cross-platform agent interaction. This short guide highlights the key differences between V1 and V2.

### V2 Impact

- **Cross-Platform Presence**: Your agent can jump from Twitter, continue via SMS, and place orders with businesses—all while maintaining conversation context.
- **Unified Blockchain Management**: One wallet to rule all chains—no more chain-switching headaches.
- **Autonomous Workflows**: Agents that handle multi-step processes independently—researching data, analyzing results, generating reports, and scheduling follow-ups without constant oversight.
- **Evolving Intelligence**: Database-driven characters that can start minimal and grow through interactions with your crowd.
- **Enhanced Security**: Native TEE integration provides verifiable security guarantees for sensitive operations while maintaining privacy.

## Core Architecture Redesign

| V1 Limitation | V2 Solution |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Bloated Core**: Codebase overloaded with packages from rapid growth | **Package Registry**: Submit plugins independently; lean codebase, no approval delays |
| **Fragmented Messaging**: Platform-specific I/O pipelines | **Unified Messaging**: Agents process inputs and output anywhere, seamlessly |
| **Wallet Overlap**: Multi-chain wallet conflicts | **Unified Inventory**: One wallet with chain-agnostic actions |
| **Rigid State**: Hardcoded goals and features | **Modular State**: Extensible, optional components for tailored agents |
| **Basic Action Chaining**: No multi-step foresight | **Strategic Planning**: Agents map out complex, sequenced workflows |

## Technical Implementation Changes

### From Clients to Services
V2 swaps Clients for Services, standardizing platform integration while centralizing message routing—agents now think once, act anywhere (Discord, Twitter, SMS, even phone calls).

### Smarter Character Evolution
V2 swaps static files for dynamic personas—agents learn from your crowd in real-time while still being able to be imported / exported as JSON files (see [docs](/docs/core/project)).

### Enhanced Development Experience
New CLI and plugin manager slashes setup time. Instead of cloning the github repo, changing to the correct branch, rebuilding, etc, it's just one command to create a new project: 

```bash
npm create eliza@beta
```

<details>
    <summary>See CLI commands</summary>
    
```bash
Usage: elizaos [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version            output the version number
  -h, --help               display help for command

Commands:
  create [options] [name]  Initialize a new project or plugin
  project                  Manage an ElizaOS project
  plugin                   Manage ElizaOS plugins, including publishing
  agent                    manage ElizaOS agents
  tee                      Manage TEE deployments
  start [options]          Start the Eliza agent with configurable plugins and services
  update [options]         Update ElizaOS packages to the latest versions
  test [options]           Run tests for Eliza agent plugins
  env                      Manage environment variables and secrets
  dev [options]            Start the project or plugin in development mode and rebuild on
                           file changes
  publish [options]        Publish a plugin or project to the registry
  help [command]           display help for command
```
</details>

### Memory and Task Management
Vector embeddings power richer memory; tasks now handle schedules and multi-step logic.

```typescript
await runtime.createTask({ ... });
```

## Timeline

- **March 2025**: Research beta now live.
- **April 2025**: Public rollout.

### Should You Upgrade?

V2 is mostly backward compatible for gradual migration. Existing projects can phase in V2 features; new ones should start with V2 for full benefits. V1 still works, but V2's modularity and planning unlock next-level autonomy. See [quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to get started.
