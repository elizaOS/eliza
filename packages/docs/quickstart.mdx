**3 minutes.** That's all it takes to go from zero to a running AI agent with memory, actions, and a web interface.

No Docker. No complex configuration. Just one command to start.

## Create Your First Agent

Let's create a project with our default Eliza character that can chat and take actions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Project">
    Create a new elizaOS project using the interactive CLI:
    ```bash Terminal
    elizaos create
    ```
    
    <Note>
      The CLI is for building agents and projects. The monorepo is only for contributing to elizaOS core. See [CLI vs Monorepo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSO4wpQs2OA&list=PLrjBjP4nU8ehOgKAa0-XddHzE0KK0nNvS).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Project">
    During the interactive setup, you'll be prompted to make the following selections:

    1. **Project Name**: Enter your desired project name
    2. **Database**: Select `pglite` for a lightweight, local PostgreSQL option
    3. **Model Provider**: Select `OpenAI` for this quickstart guide
    4. **API Key**: You'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key

    <Note>
      You can get an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
    </Note>
    
    Both database and model provider choices can be reconfigured later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Your Project">
    Change directory to your newly created project (replace with your project name):
    ```bash Terminal
    cd my-eliza-project
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your Agent">
    Launch your elizaOS project:
    ```bash Terminal
    elizaos start
    ```
    Wait a few seconds for the server to start up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Chat with Your Agent">
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
    Start chatting with Eliza through the web interface!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="API key issues">
    If you're getting authentication or configuration errors:
    
    Open your project in Cursor (or any IDE) and look at the `.env` file in your project root. Make sure these are set correctly:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
    ```
    
    ```
    PGLITE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/project/.eliza/.elizadb
    ```
    
    **Common issues:**
    - OpenAI API key is missing, invalid, or has extra spaces/quotes
    - Wrong OpenAI API key format (should start with `sk-`)
    - OpenAI account has no credits remaining
    
    **Note:** You can also configure environment variables in the terminal with `elizaos env`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="database" title="Database connection issues">
    If you're having database issues, check your `.env` file for the database path:
    ```
    PGLITE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/project/.eliza/.elizadb
    ```
    
    **Common issues:**
    - Database path is incorrect in `.env` file
    - `.eliza/.elizadb` directory doesn't exist or has wrong permissions
    - Database corruption (recreate the project if this happens)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="wrench" title="Other Common Issues">
    **When in doubt, turn it off and on again:**
    - Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`, then start it again with `elizaos start`
    - Check the [installation guide](/installation) to confirm you installed everything correctly
    
    **Still can't access the frontend after 10 seconds?**
    - If you can't reach `http://localhost:3000`, delete your project and start fresh
    - Navigate to the folder containing your project, then run:
    ```bash Terminal
    rm -rf my-eliza-project && elizaos create
    ```
    - Follow the Quickstart steps again carefully
