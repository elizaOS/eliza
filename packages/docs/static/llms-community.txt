# Instruction
# ElizaOS Developer Context

This file contains the core technical aspects of ElizaOS, focusing on its architecture, implementation, and developer-facing components. The codebase is organized as a monorepo with several key packages:

## Key Components

1. **Core Package**: The foundation of ElizaOS with the agent runtime, entity management, actions, and database interactions
2. **CLI Package**: Command-line interface for managing agents, projects, and development tasks
3. **Client Package**: Frontend interface components and API interactions
4. **SQL/Database**: Database adapters and schema management
5. **Autodoc**: Documentation generation tools

## Technical Goals

When analyzing this codebase:

- Focus on the architecture and relationships between components
- Identify core abstractions and design patterns
- Understand the runtime execution flow
- Analyze how agents, actions, and providers work together
- Look for opportunities to improve code organization and performance
- Consider modular extension points and plugin architecture

## Output Guidance

- When suggesting improvements, focus on technical aspects like code structure, performance optimizations, and architectural changes
- Include specific code examples when proposing changes
- Consider backwards compatibility and migration paths for any proposed changes
- Highlight innovative technical approaches used in the system
- When asked about implementation details, provide comprehensive technical explanations
