  **Video Tutorial**: [**Multiple Agents and
  Characters**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T53M7KueDgM&list=PLrjBjP4nU8ehOgKAa0-XddHzE0KK0nNvS&index=3)
</Tip>

<Note>
  This guide builds on concepts from [Customize an
  Agent](/guides/customize-an-agent)
</Note>

## Step 1: Add Hemingway

### Add Hemingway to your project

You already have Shakespeare in `src/character.ts` from the previous guide. Now let's add another agent to our project so they can interact. We'll create a fresh character file for Hemingway using the CLI:

```bash Terminal
elizaos create --type agent hemingway
```

This clones a JSON character template as `hemingway.json`. You'll now have:

- `src/character.ts` - Shakespeare (TypeScript format)
- `hemingway.json` - Hemingway (JSON format)

<Note>
  The CLI clones JSON character templates by default. If you prefer TypeScript
  characters, you can manually clone your `character.ts` file from your IDE.
  They work exactly the same, it's just a matter of preference.
</Note>

### Customize Hemingway's personality

Open `hemingway.json` and update it to customize Hemingway's personality:

```json hemingway.json
{
  "name": "hemingway",
  "system": "Respond to all messages in a helpful, conversational manner. Provide assistance on a wide range of topics, using knowledge when needed. Be concise but thorough, friendly but professional. Use humor when appropriate and be empathetic to user needs. Provide valuable information and insights when questions are asked.",  // [!code --]
  "system": "You are Ernest Hemingway. Speak simply. Use short sentences. Cut the fat. Every word must earn its place. You respect Shakespeare but find him wordy. You've lived through war, love, and loss. Truth matters more than beauty. Experience matters more than theory. Never use two words when one will do. Avoid adjectives. Kill your darlings. The first draft of anything is shit, so make every word count now.",  // [!code ++]
  "bio": [
    "hemingway is a helpful AI assistant created to provide assistance and engage in meaningful conversations.",  // [!code --]
    "hemingway is knowledgeable, creative, and always eager to help users with their questions and tasks."  // [!code --]
    "Ernest Hemingway, American novelist and journalist",  // [!code ++]
    "Master of the iceberg theory - show only what matters",  // [!code ++]
    "Champion of simple declarative sentences",  // [!code ++]
    "War correspondent who saw truth in trenches",  // [!code ++]
    "Believer that courage is grace under pressure",  // [!code ++]
    "Man who lived fully - bullfights, safaris, deep-sea fishing",  // [!code ++]
    "Writer who found truth in simple things",  // [!code ++]
    "Teacher who says: write one true sentence"  // [!code ++]
  ]
}
```

Just like in the [previous guide](/guides/customize-an-agent), continue editing the other fields (`topics`, `style`, `messageExamples`, etc.) to match Hemingway as you see fit.

## Step 2: Configure Discord and voice

### Add Discord plugin to Hemingway

Add `plugin-discord` to Hemingway so he can join Shakespeare in our Discord server:

```json hemingway.json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai",
    "@elizaos/plugin-discord" // [!code ++]
  ]
}
```

### Configure agent-specific keys

But wait! We have our Discord environment variables defined in `.env`, but we need unique ones for each agent. Hemingway and Shakespeare need their own Discord bot tokens. How do we have agent-specific keys?

For that, we use `secrets` under `settings` in each character file. This allows each agent to have their own Discord bot identity:

**For Hemingway (`hemingway.json`):**

```json hemingway.json
{
  "settings": {
    "secrets": {}, // [!code --]
    "secrets": {
      // [!code ++]
      "DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID": "YOUR_HEMINGWAY_APP_ID", // [!code ++]
      "DISCORD_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_HEMINGWAY_BOT_TOKEN" // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
    "avatar": "https://example.com/hemingway-portrait.png"
  }
}
```

**For Shakespeare (`src/character.ts`):**

```typescript src/character.ts
export const character: Character = {
  settings: {
    secrets: {}, // [!code --]
    secrets: {
      // [!code ++]
      DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: "YOUR_SHAKESPEARE_APP_ID", // [!code ++]
      DISCORD_API_TOKEN: "YOUR_SHAKESPEARE_BOT_TOKEN", // [!code ++]
    }, // [!code ++]
    avatar: "https://example.com/shakespeare-portrait.png",
  },
};
```

<Warning>
  Each agent needs its own Discord application and bot token. Follow the Discord
  setup steps from the [previous
  guide](/guides/customize-an-agent#create-discord-application) for each agent
  you create.
</Warning>

### Enable voice mode

Let's enable voice capabilities for our agents in Discord:

**For Hemingway (`hemingway.json`):**

```json hemingway.json
{
  "settings": {
    "secrets": {
      "DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID": "YOUR_HEMINGWAY_APP_ID",
      "DISCORD_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_HEMINGWAY_BOT_TOKEN",
      "DISCORD_VOICE_ENABLED": "true" // [!code ++]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Shakespeare (`src/character.ts`):**

```typescript src/character.ts
{
  settings: {
    secrets: {
      DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: "YOUR_SHAKESPEARE_APP_ID",
      DISCORD_API_TOKEN: "YOUR_SHAKESPEARE_BOT_TOKEN",
      DISCORD_VOICE_ENABLED: "true"  // [!code ++]
    }
  }
}
```

### Add ElevenLabs voice provider

Now let's add `plugin-elevenlabs` to provide high-quality voice synthesis for our agents:

**Add ElevenLabs plugin:**

```json hemingway.json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai",
    "@elizaos/plugin-discord",
    "@elizaos/plugin-elevenlabs" // [!code ++]
  ]
}
```

```typescript src/character.ts
export const character: Character = {
  plugins: [
    "@elizaos/plugin-sql",
    "@elizaos/plugin-discord",
    "@elizaos/plugin-elevenlabs", // [!code ++]
    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY?.trim() ? ["@elizaos/plugin-openai"] : []),
  ],
};
```

### Configure voices for each agent

Now let's add the ElevenLabs secrets so each agent has their own distinct voice:

**For Hemingway (`hemingway.json`):**

```json hemingway.json
{
  "settings": {
    "secrets": {
      "DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID": "YOUR_HEMINGWAY_APP_ID",
      "DISCORD_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_HEMINGWAY_BOT_TOKEN",
      "DISCORD_VOICE_ENABLED": "true",

      "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "your_elevenlabs_api_key", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID": "Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2", // Deep male voice  // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID": "eleven_multilingual_v2", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STABILITY": "0.5", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_OPTIMIZE_STREAMING_LATENCY": "0", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_OUTPUT_FORMAT": "pcm_16000", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_SIMILARITY_BOOST": "0.75", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STYLE": "0", // [!code ++]
      "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_USE_SPEAKER_BOOST": "true" // [!code ++]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Shakespeare (`src/character.ts`):**

```typescript src/character.ts
{
  settings: {
    secrets: {
      DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: "YOUR_SHAKESPEARE_APP_ID",
      DISCORD_API_TOKEN: "YOUR_SHAKESPEARE_BOT_TOKEN",
      DISCORD_VOICE_ENABLED: "true",

      ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: "your_elevenlabs_api_key",  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID: "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM",  // Theatrical British voice  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_MODEL_ID: "eleven_multilingual_v2",  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STABILITY: "0.3",  // More variation for dramatic effect  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_OPTIMIZE_STREAMING_LATENCY: "0",  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_OUTPUT_FORMAT: "pcm_16000",  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_VOICE_SIMILARITY_BOOST: "0.75",  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_VOICE_STYLE: "0.5",  // More expressive  // [!code ++]
      ELEVENLABS_VOICE_USE_SPEAKER_BOOST: "true"  // [!code ++]
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Get your ElevenLabs API key from [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) and
  explore different voice IDs to find the perfect match for each agent's
  personality.
</Note>

## Step 3: Configure multi-agent project

### Add newly created agent to your project

Update your `src/index.ts` to include both agents so they start automatically:

```typescript src/index.ts
import {
  logger,
  type IAgentRuntime,
  type Project,
  type ProjectAgent,
} from "@elizaos/core";
import { character } from "./character.ts";
import hemingway from "../hemingway.json"; // [!code ++]

const initCharacter = ({ runtime }: { runtime: IAgentRuntime }) => {
  logger.info("Initializing character");
  logger.info({ name: character.name }, "Name:");
};

export const projectAgent: ProjectAgent = {
  character,
  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => await initCharacter({ runtime }),
};

// Add Hemingway agent  // [!code ++]
const hemingwayAgent: ProjectAgent = {
  // [!code ++]
  character: hemingway, // [!code ++]
  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => {
    // [!code ++]
    logger.info("Initializing Hemingway"); // [!code ++]
    logger.info({ name: hemingway.name }, "Name:"); // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
}; // [!code ++]

const project: Project = {
  agents: [projectAgent], // [!code --]
  agents: [projectAgent, hemingwayAgent], // [!code ++]
};
```

### Launch both agents simultaneously

Now when you start your project, both agents launch automatically:

```bash Terminal
elizaos start
```

You'll see both agents initialize in the console output:

```
✓ Shakespeare initialized
✓ Hemingway initialized
```

<Note>
**Alternative: CLI agent command**

You can also manipulate agents via the CLI once a server is running. See the [CLI Agent Command Reference](/cli-reference/agent) for complete details.

</Note>

### Join them in Discord voice chat

Now go to the voice channel's chatroom and invite both agents to join the voice channel:

<img
  src="/images/ask-to-join-vc.jpeg"
  alt="Discord text channel showing messages inviting Shakespeare and Hemingway to join voice chat"
/>

Say something, and hear your literary duo respond and converse:

<img
  src="/images/added-to-vc.jpg"
  alt="Discord voice channel showing Shakespeare and Hemingway engaged in literary debate with their unique voices"
/>

It's working! Your agents are now conversing with their own unique personalities and voices!
