description: "How to contribute to the elizaOS core project and plugin ecosystem"
---

<Note>
  This guide covers contributing to the main elizaOS monorepo and the elizaOS
  plugin ecosystem.
</Note>

## Understanding the Ecosystem

elizaOS open source contribution happens across these main areas:

### Main Repository (Monorepo)

**[github.com/elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)** - The core monorepo containing:

- `packages/typescript` - Runtime, types, interfaces, and bootstrap plugin
- `packages/cli` - Command-line tools and elizaos CLI
- `packages/server` - Agent server implementation
- `packages/client` - Client libraries and interfaces
- Core plugins (`packages/plugin-sql`, etc.)
- Project templates (`packages/project-starter`, `packages/project-tee-starter`)
- Plugin templates (`packages/plugin-starter`, `packages/plugin-quick-starter`)
- Config files, READMEs & more

### Plugin Ecosystem

**[github.com/elizaos-plugins](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins)** - Official plugins maintained by the elizaOS team:

- `plugin-discord` - Discord integration
- `plugin-x` - X integration
- `plugin-evm` - Ethereum and blockchain functionality
- And many more frequently-used plugins

---

## Step 1: Identify an Issue

### Check Main Repository Issues

**Start here first** - Browse existing bugs in the main repo:

**[elizaos/eliza/issues](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues)**

Focus on labels like:

- `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
- `bug` - Something that needs fixing

<Note>
  The best way to start contributing is fixing reported bugs rather than writing
  new features.
</Note>

### elizaOS-Maintained Plugin Issues

Find issues in elizaOS-maintained plugins (often more focused for first contributions):

**Official elizaOS plugins:**

- [plugin-x/issues](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-x/issues)
- [plugin-discord/issues](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues)
- [plugin-evm/issues](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues)

### Community Plugin Issues

**Community plugins are separate** - These are built by the community:

- Browse the [Plugin Registry](/plugin-registry/overview) for community-maintained plugins
- Check their GitHub repositories for contribution opportunities
- Help with maintenance: updating dependencies, fixing bugs, improving docs
- Consider adopting unmaintained plugins by forking and continuing development

### Creating Issues for New Bugs

If you discover a bug without an existing issue:

1. **Reproduce the bug** consistently & locally
2. **Check if it's already reported** by searching existing issues
3. **Create a detailed issue** with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, Node/Bun version, elizaOS version)
   - Error messages or logs

```markdown Issue Template Example
## Bug Description

The Discord plugin fails to connect when using voice channels

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure agent with Discord and ElevenLabs plugins
2. Invite agent to voice channel
3. Agent connects but immediately disconnects

## Expected Behavior

Agent should remain connected and respond with voice

## Environment

- elizaOS version: 1.4.4
- Node version: 23.3
- OS: macOS 14.0
```

### Contribute to Docs and Community

Beyond code contributions, you can help in these important areas:

**Documentation contributions:**

- Add tutorials to the tutorials section in [docs repository](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)
- Update any outdated references, instructions, or broken links you find
- Fix typos, improve clarity, or add missing examples

**Community support:**

- **Answer questions** in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/elizaOS/discussions) Q&A section
- **Help with troubleshooting** - Setup issues, configuration problems, etc.
- **Share knowledge** in general discussions about elizaOS development
- **Showcase projects** in show and tell or participate in feature discussions

<Tip>
  Community contributions like answering questions and writing tutorials are
  often the most impactful ways to help other developers succeed with elizaOS.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Contribution Workflow

elizaOS follows standard open source contribution practices for all repositories.

### Clone and Set Up Repository

1. **Clone the repository** you want to contribute to on your local machine
2. **Create a branch** off the `develop` branch for monorepo or `1.x` branch for plugins
3. **Install dependencies** and build the project

### Make Your Changes Locally

**Focus on these types of contributions:**

- Fix existing functionality that isn't working
- Improve error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation corrections

<Warning>
  Large refactors are unlikely to be accepted. Focus on incremental improvements
  and bug fixes first. Always discuss major architectural changes with core
  developers before starting work.
</Warning>

**Implementation steps:**

1. **Make your changes** to fix the bug or implement the improvement
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly - run existing tests and add new ones if needed
3. **Ensure code quality** - follow linting rules and TypeScript requirements

### Submit Your Pull Request

**Target the correct branch:**

- **Main repository (elizaos/eliza):** Target `develop` branch
- **Plugin repositories:** Target `1.x` branch (or check the default branch)

**Create a detailed pull request** with:

- Clear description of what the PR does
- Link to the related issue (`Fixes #123`)
- List of specific changes made
- Check that CI/GitHub Actions are passing
- Screenshots if there are UI changes

### Collaborate During Review

- Respond to code review comments promptly
- Make requested changes in additional commits
- Be open to feedback and iteration

### Code Quality Standards

**What we look for:**

- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Performance improvements with benchmarks
- Documentation improvements and corrections
- Test coverage improvements
- Security fixes

**Technical requirements:**

- **TypeScript**: All code must be properly typed
- **Testing**: New features require tests, bug fixes should include regression tests
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for any user-facing changes
- **Linting**: Code must pass all linting checks
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages

## Step 3: Get Connected

### Join Discord for Development

Connect with core developers and other contributors:

**[Join elizaOS Discord](https://discord.gg/ai16z)**

Key channels for contributors:

- **💬 #coders** - Development discussions and questions
- **💻 #tech-support** - Help others troubleshoot and get help yourself

### Communicate Before Major Work

For significant contributions:

1. **Post in 💬 #coders** about your planned contribution
2. **Share your approach** before implementing large features
3. **Ask questions** - the community is helpful and welcoming

<Tip>
  Core developers are active in Discord and can provide guidance on whether your
  planned contribution aligns with project goals.
</Tip>

### Build Community Connections

- Participate in discussions and help answer questions
- Share your progress and learn from others
- Connect with the core devs & other community contributors
- Stay updated on project direction and roadmap
