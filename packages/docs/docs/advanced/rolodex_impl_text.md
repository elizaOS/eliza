Please review the report here: @entities-relationships.md @future-autonomous-agents.md @plan.md

Review the codebase for core and the relationship plugin, come up with 4-5 different implementation strategies to fully execute the entire scope of the Rolodex (entity management, tracking, follow up messaging, list of friends, relationship information, etc etc)

Then write a report on a detailed implementation strategy based on what you think is the best and most forward thiking approach. Include exactly what files, services, systems etc will need to be added or altered. Identify what needs to be changed or added to core and hwat needs to go into the plugin.

Once you've done this, save the implementation plan for entity relatioships to the same docs folder, then proceed to implement
