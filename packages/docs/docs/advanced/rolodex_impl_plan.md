Based on my analysis of the codebase and reports, I've identified the current state and gaps. Let me present 4-5 implementation strategies for a comprehensive Rolodex plugin.
Current State Summary
The core already has:
Basic entity tracking with UUID-based identification
Entity resolution using LLM
Relationship model with source/target entities
Component system for flexible data storage
Trust profiles and verification levels
The plugin-rolodex has minimal implementation with basic actions and providers.
Implementation Strategies
Strategy 1: Minimal Enhancement (Quick Win)
Focus: Extend existing plugin-rolodex with essential features
Add contact categorization (friend, colleague, acquaintance) using relationship tags
Implement basic follow-up scheduling using existing task system
Create providers for contact queries ("who are my friends", "pending follow-ups")
Add actions for managing contact lists and scheduling follow-ups
Pros: Quick implementation, minimal core changes, leverages existing infrastructure
Cons: Limited functionality, no advanced features
Strategy 2: Task-Integrated Contact Manager
Focus: Deep integration with task system for relationship maintenance
Create specialized task workers for relationship management
Implement periodic check-ins and follow-up reminders
Add relationship health monitoring with automatic task creation
Build providers that combine entity and task data
Create actions for bulk operations (import contacts, schedule multiple follow-ups)
Pros: Powerful automation, proactive relationship management
Cons: Complex task orchestration, potential performance issues
Strategy 3: Component-Based Extensible System
Focus: Use core's component system for maximum flexibility
Define rolodex-specific component schemas (ContactInfo, InteractionHistory, Preferences)
Create component-based providers for rich queries
Implement privacy layers using component visibility
Add platform-specific adapters for contact import/export
Build relationship analytics using component data
Pros: Highly extensible, platform-agnostic, preserves privacy
Cons: Requires careful schema design, more complex queries
Strategy 4: Cross-Platform Identity Resolution Focus
Focus: Advanced identity management across platforms
Implement ML-enhanced entity resolution
Create identity graph with confidence scores
Add platform-specific identity providers
Build unified contact view across all platforms
Implement contact merge/split capabilities
Pros: Solves real cross-platform problem, valuable for multi-platform agents
Cons: Complex implementation, requires careful entity resolution
Strategy 5: Comprehensive Social CRM (Recommended)
Focus: Full-featured contact and relationship management system
Core Enhancements:
Add relationship strength calculation to core
Enhance entity resolution with behavioral patterns
Add entity lifecycle events (created, merged, updated)
Plugin Features:
Full contact management with categories and tags
Automated follow-up scheduling with smart suggestions
Relationship analytics and insights
Cross-platform identity resolution
Privacy and permission management
Import/export capabilities
Rich providers for complex queries
Integration with communication actions
Bulk operations support
Pros: Complete solution, professional-grade CRM capabilities
Cons: Requires core changes, longer implementation time
My Recommendation
I recommend Strategy 5: Comprehensive Social CRM because:
It provides the most value for users managing relationships
The core enhancements are minimal but impactful
It leverages all existing systems (entities, relationships, tasks, components)
It sets up the plugin for future enhancements
It solves real problems agents face in relationship management
Detailed Implementation Plan for Comprehensive Social CRM
Based on my analysis, here's a detailed implementation plan for Strategy 5:
Core Changes (Minimal but Impactful)
Enhanced Relationship Model (packages/core/src/types/environment.ts):
Add relationshipType?: string field (friend, colleague, acquaintance, family, etc.)
Add strength?: number field for relationship strength (0-100)
Add lastInteractionAt?: string field
Add nextFollowUpAt?: string field
Entity Lifecycle Events (packages/core/src/entities.ts):
Add event emitter for entity lifecycle (created, updated, merged)
Emit events when entities are resolved or merged
Add calculateRelationshipStrength() function
Enhanced Entity Resolution (packages/core/src/entities.ts):
Improve findEntityByName() with behavioral pattern matching
Add confidence scores to entity resolution
Support for entity aliasing/nicknames
Plugin Implementation (packages/plugin-rolodex)
Services:
RolodexService: Main service for contact management
Contact CRUD operations
Relationship analytics
Privacy management
FollowUpService: Task-based follow-up scheduling
Smart follow-up suggestions
Recurring check-ins
Integration with task system
IdentityResolutionService: Cross-platform identity management
Platform identity mapping
Confidence scoring
Identity merge/split operations
Actions:
Contact Management:
addContact: Add new contact with category and metadata
