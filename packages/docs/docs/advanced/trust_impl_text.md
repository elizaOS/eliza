There may be some interrelationship with relationships, @/plugin-rolodex please review the plans for the rolodex plugin and identify how these two projects might relate or interconnect, if at all @rolodex_impl_plan.md @entities-relationships.md

So your goal is to write a detailed implementation plan on how we can effectively end-to-end manage roles, trust, and with regard to how it'll call actions or enable functionality. Please review the existing code that we have that already implements many of these concepts, examine and identify the end-to-end workflow of the application and how it runs and works. Then write a detailed implementation plan for how we can implement everything around our goals of role as in trust, get into extreme detail including what files will be added, changed, modified, removed, what systems need to be added, what services, what can be changed in core. Basically every single thing you could imagine that would then be needed for a senior engineer to go and actually implement it without having to think too much. Be extremely thorough in this.

You should really examine at least four or five different approaches for how we might fully implement this and what the strengths and weaknesses of those are. If there's any research to support them, if they're flexible and forward-thinking, and enable more in the stack. Then pick what you think is the most realistic and best for our use cases to enable autonomous agents to trust people across different servers, channels, platforms, and all of that.

Save the implementation plan to a document called Trust Implementation Plan.

Also think of a list of scenarios and we'll save this to the docs as roles_scenarios.md with a list of scenarios that demonstrate failure cases, success cases, normal operations, edge cases for how we might use roles and trust among colleagues, friends, enemies, community members, random social graph. Pretty much anything you could think of. Be extensive and creative and save this to the markdown.

After you save these two documents, go ahead and start implementing.
