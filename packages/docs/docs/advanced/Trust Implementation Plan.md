# Trust Implementation Plan for ElizaOS

## Executive Summary

This document outlines 5 different approaches for implementing a comprehensive trust and permission system in ElizaOS that enables autonomous agents to build and maintain trust relationships across multiple platforms while maintaining security. After careful analysis, **Approach 3: Phased Trust Platform** is recommended as the optimal solution.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components

1. **plugin-trust**: Basic RBAC with OWNER, ADMIN, NONE roles stored in world metadata
2. **plugin-rolodex**: Contact management with relationship tracking and analytics
3. **plugin-secrets-manager**: Environment variable management with validation
4. **Core Runtime**: Entity resolution, memory system, and component storage

### Key Gaps

- No multi-dimensional trust scoring system
- No cross-platform identity verification
- No integration between roles, trust, and relationships
- No protection against prompt injection or social engineering
- No dynamic permission elevation based on trust
- No contextual permissions (different roles in different contexts)

## Approach 1: Monolithic Trust Service

### Overview

Create a single, comprehensive trust service that handles all aspects of roles, trust, and permissions.

### Architecture

```typescript
// Single service handling everything
class UnifiedTrustService extends Service {
  // Role management
  async assignRole(entityId: UUID, role: Role, context: Context): Promise<void>;
  async checkPermission(entityId: UUID, action: string, resource: string): Promise<boolean>;

  // Trust scoring
  async calculateTrust(entityId: UUID): Promise<TrustProfile>;
  async updateTrustScore(entityId: UUID, evidence: TrustEvidence): Promise<void>;

  // Identity verification
  async verifyIdentity(entityId: UUID, platform: string, handle: string): Promise<boolean>;
  async linkIdentities(identities: PlatformIdentity[]): Promise<UUID>;
}
```

### Pros

- Simple to understand and maintain
- All logic in one place
- Easy to ensure consistency

### Cons

- Violates single responsibility principle
- Difficult to extend or modify individual components
- Creates a single point of failure
- Hard to test individual features
- Not aligned with ElizaOS plugin architecture

### Implementation Effort

- **Time**: 4-6 weeks
- **Complexity**: High (due to size)
- **Risk**: High (all-or-nothing deployment)

## Approach 2: Microservices Pattern

### Overview

Break down the trust system into multiple independent services that communicate via events.

### Architecture

```typescript
// Separate services for each concern
class RoleService extends Service {
  static serviceType = 'roles';
  // Handle only role management
}

class TrustScoringService extends Service {
  static serviceType = 'trust-scoring';
  // Handle only trust calculations
}

class IdentityService extends Service {
  static serviceType = 'identity';
  // Handle only identity verification
}

class PermissionService extends Service {
  static serviceType = 'permissions';
  // Orchestrate between roles and trust
}
```

### Pros

- Clear separation of concerns
- Can develop and deploy independently
- Easy to test individual components
- Follows ElizaOS service pattern

### Cons

- Complex inter-service communication
- Potential for inconsistent state
- Higher operational overhead
- May have performance issues due to service calls

### Implementation Effort

- **Time**: 6-8 weeks
- **Complexity**: Very High
- **Risk**: Medium (can fail partially)

## Approach 3: Phased Trust Platform (RECOMMENDED)

### Overview

Implement a modular trust platform that extends existing plugins while maintaining backward compatibility. Build incrementally with clear phases.

### Architecture

#### Phase 1: Trust Engine Core (Weeks 1-2)

```typescript
// Extend existing plugin-trust with trust scoring
interface TrustDimensions {
  reliability: number; // 0-100: Promise keeping, consistency
  competence: number; // 0-100: Task completion ability
  integrity: number; // 0-100: Ethical behavior
  benevolence: number; // 0-100: Good intentions
  transparency: number; // 0-100: Open communication
}

class TrustEngine {
  async calculateTrust(
    evaluatorId: UUID,
    subjectId: UUID,
    context?: TrustContext
  ): Promise<TrustProfile>;

  async recordInteraction(interaction: TrustInteraction): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Phase 2: Identity Resolution (Weeks 3-4)

```typescript
// Add to plugin-rolodex as identity management
interface CrossPlatformIdentity {
  primaryEntityId: UUID;
  verifiedIdentities: VerifiedIdentity[];
  claimedIdentities: ClaimedIdentity[];
  trustScore: number;
}

class IdentityResolver {
  async resolveIdentity(platform: string, handle: string): Promise<UUID | null>;

  async verifyIdentity(entityId: UUID, platform: string, verificationData: any): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### Phase 3: Contextual Permissions (Weeks 5-6)

```typescript
// Enhance permission system with contexts
interface ContextualRole {
  role: Role;
  context: {
    worldId?: UUID;
    roomId?: UUID;
    platform?: string;
    timeWindow?: TimeWindow;
  };
  trustRequirements?: TrustRequirements;
}

class ContextualPermissionSystem {
  async hasPermission(
    entityId: UUID,
    action: string,
    resource: string,
    context: Context
  ): Promise<PermissionDecision>;
}
```

#### Phase 4: Integration Layer (Weeks 7-8)

```typescript
// Unified API that combines all components
class TrustPlatform {
  constructor(
    private roleService: RoleService,
    private trustEngine: TrustEngine,
    private identityResolver: IdentityResolver,
    private permissions: ContextualPermissionSystem
  )

  async evaluateRequest(
    request: AccessRequest
  ): Promise<AccessDecision>
}
```

### Implementation Details

#### Data Storage

```typescript
// Extend existing component system
interface TrustComponent extends Component {
  type: 'trust_profile';
  data: {
    dimensions: TrustDimensions;
    evidence: TrustEvidence[];
    lastCalculated: timestamp;
  };
}

interface IdentityComponent extends Component {
  type: 'identity_verification';
  data: {
    platform: string;
    handle: string;
    verificationMethod: string;
    verifiedAt: timestamp;
    trustImpact: number;
  };
}
```

#### Security Features

```typescript
class SecurityModule {
  // Prompt injection detection
  async detectPromptInjection(message: string, context: Context): Promise<ThreatAssessment>;

  // Social engineering detection
  async detectSocialEngineering(
    conversation: Message[],
    requestedAction: string
  ): Promise<RiskScore>;

  // Anomaly detection
  async detectAnomalousRequest(
    entityId: UUID,
    request: AccessRequest,
    historicalBehavior: BehaviorProfile
  ): Promise<AnomalyScore>;
}
```

### Pros

- Builds on existing infrastructure
- Can be implemented incrementally
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Clear upgrade path
- Testable at each phase
- Aligns with ElizaOS architecture

### Cons

- Requires careful planning
- May have temporary feature gaps between phases
- Need to maintain compatibility during development

### Implementation Effort

- **Time**: 8 weeks (2 weeks per phase)
- **Complexity**: Medium (spread across phases)
- **Risk**: Low (incremental deployment)

## Approach 4: Trust Graph Network

### Overview

Implement trust as a graph database with nodes (entities) and edges (trust relationships).

### Architecture

```typescript
interface TrustNode {
  entityId: UUID;
  metadata: EntityMetadata;
  trustProfile: TrustProfile;
}

interface TrustEdge {
  source: UUID;
  target: UUID;
  trustScore: number;
  evidence: TrustEvidence[];
  context: Context;
}

class TrustGraph {
  async addNode(entity: Entity): Promise<TrustNode>;
  async addEdge(relationship: TrustRelationship): Promise<TrustEdge>;
  async calculateTrust(from: UUID, to: UUID, maxHops?: number): Promise<number>;
  async findTrustPath(from: UUID, to: UUID): Promise<TrustPath[]>;
}
```

### Pros

- Natural representation of trust relationships
- Supports transitive trust
- Can leverage graph algorithms
- Scalable for large networks

### Cons

- Requires graph database infrastructure
- Complex to implement correctly
- May be overkill for current needs
- Performance concerns for deep traversals

### Implementation Effort

- **Time**: 10-12 weeks
- **Complexity**: Very High
- **Risk**: High (new infrastructure)

## Approach 5: Federated Trust System

### Overview

Create a federated system where each platform/world maintains its own trust scores that can be aggregated.

### Architecture

```typescript
interface FederatedTrustProvider {
  platform: string;
  async getTrustScore(entityId: UUID): Promise<PlatformTrust>
  async reportInteraction(interaction: Interaction): Promise<void>
}

class FederatedTrustAggregator {
  providers: Map<string, FederatedTrustProvider>;

  async getGlobalTrust(entityId: UUID): Promise<GlobalTrustProfile>
  async getPlatformTrust(entityId: UUID, platform: string): Promise<PlatformTrust>

  private async aggregateTrust(
    platformScores: PlatformTrust[]
  ): Promise<GlobalTrustProfile>
}
```

### Pros

- Respects platform boundaries
- Can integrate with external trust systems
- Distributed and resilient
- Natural for multi-platform agents

### Cons

- Complex aggregation logic
- Potential for trust manipulation
- Requires platform cooperation
- Inconsistent trust models across platforms

### Implementation Effort

- **Time**: 8-10 weeks
- **Complexity**: High
- **Risk**: Medium (external dependencies)
