## Build AI Agents That Actually Work

Three commands. That's all it takes.

```bash
bun i -g elizaos          # Install the CLI
elizaos create            # Create your project
elizaos start             # Your agent is live
```

elizaOS is the TypeScript framework for building AI agents that think, learn, and act autonomously. Define a personality, add plugins, deploy anywhere.

## Design Philosophy

**Ship Fast** — Three commands to a live agent. No boilerplate, no config hell.

**Scale Freely** — Start with a character file. Scale to millions of interactions.

**Truly Open** — Every line is open source. Extend through plugins, contribute to core, build the future together.
