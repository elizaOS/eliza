## Vesting and Transparency

All token allocations follow structured vesting schedules with built-in transparency mechanisms:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ecosystem/Community">3-month cliff + 9-month linear vest</Step>

<Step title="Foundation">24-month linear vest</Step>

<Step title="Team & Contributors">
  12-month cliff from October 21, then 24-month linear vest (total 36 months)
</Step>

<Step title="SAFT">Locked multisig, minimum 12-month cliff</Step>

  <Step title="Liquidity & POL">Programmatic for market making</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Monitoring:** All vesting wallets will be publicly listed with explorer
  links for real-time tracking. Streamflow contracts enforce cliffs and prevent
  discretionary early unlocks.
</Note>

## Token Release Schedule

After the migration from `$ai16z` to `$elizaOS`, the `$elizaOS` total supply will gradually expand from 6.6B to 11B (+40%), with circulating supply increasing by 882M, from 6.6B to 7.4B (approximately +13%) immediately.

This unlocks capital for increased liquidity demands of the token becoming multichain and funding ecosystem growth – including:

- **607M tokens** for liquidity & listings
- **275M tokens** of Protocol Owned Liquidity

<Warning>
  Over time, total supply could expand to up to 11B tokens, though actual
  circulating supply may be less as a large portion is held by the Foundation
  and Treasury for ecosystem development and liquidity management.
</Warning>
