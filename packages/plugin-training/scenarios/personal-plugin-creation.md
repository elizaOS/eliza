# Personal Plugin Creation Scenario

## Scenario: "Help me remember my grandmother's recipes"

**User**: "My grandmother passed away last year and I have all her handwritten recipe cards. I want to create a plugin that can help me digitize, organize, and share her recipes with my family. It should be able to read her handwriting, categorize recipes by occasion (like her Sunday dinners or holiday cookies), and even suggest what to cook based on available ingredients. This is really important to me - it's how I want to keep her memory alive."

**Agent Response**: "I'd be honored to help you create something so meaningful to preserve your grandmother's culinary legacy. Let me build a custom plugin specifically for her recipes. This will be called the 'Heritage Recipe Keeper' plugin."

## Plugin Generation Process

### Step 1: Understanding Requirements
The agent analyzes the personal request and identifies:
- Handwriting recognition for recipe cards
- Recipe categorization by occasion/event
- Ingredient-based recipe suggestions
- Family sharing capabilities
- Emotional significance and memory preservation

### Step 2: Plugin Architecture Design
```typescript
// @elizaos/plugin-heritage-recipes
Components needed:
- RecipeDigitizationService (OCR for handwriting)
- RecipeCategorizationAction (AI-powered organization)
- IngredientMatchingProvider (smart suggestions)
- MemoryPreservationEvaluator (captures family stories)

```

### Step 3: Generated Plugin Features

5. **ADD_RECIPE_STORY** - Captures memories associated with recipes

#### Service Generated:
**HeritageRecipeService** with capabilities:
- Handwriting OCR using multiple AI models
- Recipe parsing and structured storage
- Family tree integration for sharing permissions
- Memory association and story linking
- Ingredient inventory tracking

#### Provider Created:
**GrandmotherMemoryProvider** that includes:
- Available recipes from her collection
- Seasonal recipe suggestions
- Family occasion reminders
- Ingredient inventory status

#### Evaluator Implemented:
**RecipeMemoryEvaluator** that:
- Captures family stories during recipe discussions
- Links recipes to specific memories and occasions
- Identifies when someone mentions cooking grandmother's food
- Automatically suggests related recipes

## Sample Interaction After Plugin Creation

**User**: "I just found grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe card"

**Agent**: "How wonderful! Let me help you digitize that precious recipe. Please share a photo of the card and I'll use the Heritage Recipe Keeper to process her handwriting and add it to your family collection."

*[User uploads photo]*

**Agent**: "I've successfully digitized grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe! Here's what I captured:

**Grandma's Famous Chocolate Chip Cookies**
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup butter (softened)  
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups chocolate chips

*Bake at 375Â°F for 9-11 minutes*

I've categorized this under 'Holiday Treats' and 'Comfort Food'. Would you like to add any family memories about when she made these cookies?"

**User**: "She always made these for Christmas Eve. The whole house would smell amazing."

**Agent**: "That's a beautiful memory. I've added that to the recipe's story. Now when Christmas approaches, I'll remind you about these cookies and suggest making them to continue the tradition. I've also noted that you currently have all the ingredients except chocolate chips - would you like me to add those to your shopping list?"

## Plugin Code Generation Summary

The agent would generate approximately 1,200 lines of production-ready code including:

### Core Service (HeritageRecipeService.ts)
```typescript
export class HeritageRecipeService extends Service {
  static serviceName = 'heritage-recipes';
  
  async digitizeRecipeCard(imageBuffer: Buffer): Promise<ParsedRecipe> {
    // OCR processing with handwriting recognition
    // Recipe parsing and ingredient extraction
    // Memory association and categorization
  }
  
  async suggestRecipesByIngredients(available: string[]): Promise<Recipe[]> {
    // Smart matching algorithm
    // Seasonal preferences
    // Family occasion awareness
  }
}
```

### Personal Actions
- DIGITIZE_RECIPE: Processes grandmother's handwritten cards
- CATEGORIZE_RECIPE: Organizes by family occasions
- SUGGEST_RECIPE: Ingredient-based recommendations
- SHARE_FAMILY_RECIPE: Secure family sharing
- ADD_RECIPE_STORY: Captures precious memories

### Memory Integration
- Links recipes to family stories and occasions
- Tracks which family members have which recipes
- Reminds about seasonal cooking traditions
- Preserves the emotional context of each dish

## Emotional Intelligence Features

The plugin includes special emotional awareness:
- Recognizes anniversary dates and suggests commemorative cooking

- Maintains the personal connection to grandmother's memory

## Privacy & Security
