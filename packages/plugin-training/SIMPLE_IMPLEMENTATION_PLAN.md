# Simple Implementation Plan: Actually Working Together.ai Integration

## The KISS Principle Applied

Based on the scathing (but accurate) review, here's what we'll actually build:

## Phase 1: Basic Together.ai Client (WORKING)
- Simple file upload to Together.ai
- Basic fine-tuning job creation
- Job status monitoring
- NO over-engineering, NO fake event systems

## Phase 2: Manual Training Data Collection
- CLI command to add training examples manually
- Simple JSONL file generation
- Basic validation (actually working)
- File-based storage (no phantom databases)

## Phase 3: Simple Training Pipeline
- Upload dataset to Together.ai
- Start training job
- Monitor progress
- Download results

## Phase 4: Basic Testing and Validation
- Simple inference testing
- Cost calculation (real numbers)
- Basic deployment recommendations

## What We're NOT Building
- ❌ Fake event systems
- ❌ Complex pipeline orchestration
- ❌ Imaginary automation
- ❌ Over-engineered abstractions
- ❌ Non-existent integrations

## What We ARE Building
- ✅ Working Together.ai API client
- ✅ Real file operations with error handling
- ✅ Simple JSONL dataset creation
- ✅ Basic CLI commands
- ✅ Actual tests that pass
- ✅ Simple cost calculations

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Dependencies and Basic Setup
1. Add proper Node.js FormData polyfill
2. Set up real file system operations
3. Create basic CLI structure
4. Write actual tests

### Step 2: Working Together.ai Client
1. Real API integration with proper error handling
2. File upload that actually works
3. Job monitoring that connects to real API
4. Simple cost calculation based on real pricing

### Step 3: Simple Dataset Management
1. File-based storage for training examples
2. Basic JSONL generation with real validation
3. Simple CLI to add examples manually
4. Dataset splitting and formatting

### Step 4: Basic Training Pipeline
1. Upload datasets to Together.ai
2. Start training jobs with real parameters
3. Monitor progress with actual status checks
4. Handle errors and retries properly

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests with mocked Together.ai API
3. End-to-end tests with real data
4. CLI command testing

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Can add training examples via CLI
- ✅ Can generate valid JSONL datasets
- ✅ Can upload to Together.ai (with real API key)
- ✅ Can start and monitor training jobs
- ✅ Can test inference with trained models
- ✅ All operations have proper error handling
- ✅ No over-engineering or fake abstractions

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Fix basic infrastructure and dependencies
- **Day 2**: Implement working Together.ai client
- **Day 3**: Build simple dataset management
- **Day 4**: Create training pipeline
- **Day 5**: Add comprehensive testing
- **Day 6**: Polish CLI and documentation

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. **NO** fake event systems
2. **NO** complex abstractions
3. **NO** imaginary integrations
4. **NO** over-engineered pipelines
5. **NO** untested code
6. **NO** made-up types and interfaces

## Quality Gates
- Every component must have working tests
- Every CLI command must be manually testable
- Every API call must handle real error responses
- Every file operation must validate inputs
- No code without corresponding tests

This plan focuses on building something that actually works rather than impressive-looking vaporware.
