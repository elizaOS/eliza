## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **TogetherAIClient** - API integration for fine-tuning and model management
2. **AutomatedDataCollector** - Monitors and captures successful code generation events
3. **ThinkingBlockGenerator** - Creates perfect reasoning paths for training data
4. **JSONLDatasetProcessor** - Formats datasets for Together.ai requirements
5. **TogetherAIAutomationService** - Orchestrates the complete pipeline

### Target Models

- **Small Model**: deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5b (3GB, efficient inference)

## Complete Automation Pipeline

### Phase 1: Automated Data Collection

**Trigger Events:**
- Successful plugin creation via autocoder
- Successful MCP server generation
- Any successful code generation workflow

**Data Capture Process:**
1. Event listener detects successful completion
2. Extracts original request, generated code, and outcome metrics
3. Assesses quality based on:
   - Execution time (faster = higher quality)
   - File count and complexity
   - Success indicators
   - Code structure and completeness

**Quality Scoring:**
```typescript
Base quality: 0.5
+ Success completion: +0.3
+ Multiple files: +0.1
+ Fast execution (<30s): +0.1
+ Complex implementation (>3 files): +0.1
Maximum quality: 1.0
```

### Phase 2: Thinking Block Generation

**Perfect Reasoning Creation:**
For each successful completion, generates a comprehensive thinking block showing:

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Breaking down user request into clear goals
2. **Architecture Planning** - Designing the optimal solution structure
3. **Implementation Strategy** - Step-by-step development approach
4. **File Structure Reasoning** - Explaining each file's purpose and components
5. **Code Implementation Logic** - Detailing the actual coding decisions
6. **Testing Approach** - Validation and error handling strategy
7. **Final Verification** - Confirming the solution meets all requirements

**Example Thinking Block Structure:**
```
<thinking>
The user is asking me to create a new ElizaOS plugin. Let me break this down:

Requirements Analysis:
- Primary Goal: Create a weather plugin for location-based forecasts
- Required Features:
  * Fetch weather data from external API
  * Provide current conditions and forecasts
  * Handle location resolution

Architecture Planning:
For an ElizaOS plugin, I need to follow the standard plugin architecture:
- Main plugin file (index.ts) with Plugin interface implementation
- Actions for user interactions
- Providers for context injection
- Proper TypeScript types and interfaces

[... detailed reasoning continues ...]
</thinking>
```

### Phase 3: Dataset Preparation

**JSONL Format Conversion:**
- **Small Model Dataset**: Simplified prompts, no thinking blocks, 2K token limit
- **Large Model Dataset**: Complete thinking blocks, complex examples, 8K token limit

**Dataset Validation:**
- Proper message structure (system, user, assistant)
- Token count validation
- Format compliance with Together.ai requirements
- Quality filtering and deduplication

**Data Splits:**
- Training: 80%
- Validation: 10%
- Test: 10%

### Phase 4: Parallel Model Training

**Small Model Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  baseModel: 'deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-1.5b',
  epochs: 3,
  learningRate: 1e-5,
  batchSize: 4,
  useLoRA: true,
  trainingType: 'supervised'
}
```

**Large Model Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  baseModel: 'Deepseek-R1-distill-llama-70b',
  epochs: 3,
  learningRate: 1e-6,
  batchSize: 1,
  useLoRA: true,
  trainingType: 'supervised'
}
```

**Monitoring & Management:**
- Real-time job status tracking
- Training metrics collection
- Automatic error handling and retry logic
- Cost tracking and budget management

### Phase 5: Intelligent Deployment

**Decision Matrix:**

| Model Size | Usage Level | Budget | Recommendation | Implementation |
|------------|-------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| <3GB | Any | Any | Local (Ollama) | Download + GGUF conversion |
| 3-10GB | <100K tokens/month | <$200/month | Together.ai | API hosting |
| 3-10GB | >100K tokens/month | >$200/month | Local GPU | Cloud infrastructure |
| >10GB | Any | Any | Together.ai | API hosting |

**Cost Analysis:**
- Together.ai: $0.2-$2.0 per 1M tokens (model dependent)
