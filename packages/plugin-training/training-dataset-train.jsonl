Average response time is under 200ms. The caching layer is working perfectly\n[1:12:00 AM] Charlie DevOps: That's impressive! Are you using Redis for caching?\n[1:15:00 AM] Alice Developer: Yes, Redis for session state and response caching. Plus I'm using the built-in memory provider from ElizaOS core for conversation context\n[1:20:00 AM] Diana SRE: Nice architecture! How many concurrent users can it handle?\n[1:25:00 AM] Alice Developer: We tested up to 1000 concurrent connections and it was still stable.
