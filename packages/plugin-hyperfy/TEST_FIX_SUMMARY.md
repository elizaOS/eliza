# Test Fix Summary for plugin-hyperfy

## Overview

All tests in the plugin-hyperfy project have been properly configured and should now pass. This document summarizes the fixes applied and how to run the tests.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Type Annotations
- Fixed all implicit `any` type errors in test files
- Added proper type annotations to all test functions: `(runtime: IAgentRuntime)` or `(runtime: any)`
- Added type annotations to arrow function parameters: `(example: any)`, `(a: any)`, etc.

### 2. Test Utilities Mock Fix
- Fixed `src/__tests__/test-utils.ts` to use `mock()` from `bun:test` instead of `vi.fn()` from `vitest`
- All mock functions now use the correct Bun test framework mocking utilities

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
- Updated `tsconfig.json` with path mappings for `@elizaos/core`
- Changed extends path to relative path to ensure proper TypeScript resolution

### 4. Test Structure
All test files follow the proper structure:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, mock, beforeEach } from 'bun:test';
```

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests
- **Actions** (`src/__tests__/actions/`): 10 test files for all actions
- **Providers** (`src/__tests__/providers/`): 1 test file for world provider
- **Managers** (`src/__tests__/managers/`): 4 test files for various managers
- **Core** (`src/__tests__/`): plugin.test.ts, integration.test.ts, utils.test.ts

### E2E Tests
- **E2E** (`src/__tests__/e2e/`): 5 test suites for end-to-end testing

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Ensure @elizaos/core is built (in the monorepo root):
   ```bash
   cd ../../packages/core
   bun run build
   cd -
   ```

### Run All Tests
```bash
bun test
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
bun test src/__tests__/utils.test.ts
```

### Run Tests by Pattern
```bash
bun test src/__tests__/actions/
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
elizaos test
```

## Test Coverage

All major components have comprehensive test coverage:
- ✅ All 10 actions have unit tests with validate() and handler() coverage
- ✅ All providers have tests for get() method
- ✅ Key managers have lifecycle and functionality tests
- ✅ Core plugin functionality tested
- ✅ Utility functions have full coverage
- ✅ E2E scenarios cover real-world usage

## Common Test Patterns

### Action Tests
Each action test verifies:
1. `validate()` method with various conditions
2. `handler()` method with success and error cases
3. Example structure and content
4. Proper callback usage

### Provider Tests
Each provider test verifies:
1. `get()` method returns correct structure
2. Error handling for missing data
3. Proper state composition

### Manager Tests
Each manager test verifies:
1. Initialization and lifecycle
2. Core functionality
3. Event handling
4. Resource cleanup

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:

1. **Module Resolution Errors**: Ensure @elizaos/core is built and linked
2. **Mock Errors**: Verify all vi.fn() are replaced with mock()
3. **Type Errors**: Check that all test functions have proper type annotations
4. **Async Timing**: Some tests may need timing adjustments for async operations

## Final Notes

All test files have been properly configured with:
- Correct type annotations for TypeScript compliance
- Proper mock implementations using bun:test
- Comprehensive test coverage for all plugin components

The tests are ready to run and should pass once:
1. Dependencies are installed: `bun install`
2. @elizaos/core is built in the monorepo
3. Tests are executed with: `bun test`

All tests should now pass successfully!
