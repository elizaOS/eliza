// #9143 — per-plugin home-widget coverage gate.
//
// The contract: every manifest plugin opted onto the frontpage resolves at
// least one `home`-slot widget (its own bundled component OR a shared
// `defaultWidget` sink) via `resolveWidgetsForSlot`. This enumerates the
// opted-in batch and asserts each resolves a rendered component, so a future
// edit that drops a declaration (or its sink mapping) fails CI here.
//
// IDs are the runtime plugin IDs (package name with `@elizaos/plugin-`
// stripped — see plugin-discovery-helpers `workspacePluginIdFromPackageName`),
// which is exactly what `PluginInfo.id` carries in the live plugin snapshot.
