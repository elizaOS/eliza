// 1. Start a research project

// 2. Check research status
const example2 = {
  user: "How's the research going?",
  agent: 'Let me check the status of your research project.',
  // Agent internally calls: check_research_status action
  result:
    "Your research on 'latest AI breakthroughs in 2024' is 60% complete. Currently in the analyzing phase. I've found 15 sources and am processing the findings.",

/**
 * Behind the scenes, the plugin will:
 *
 * 1. Use the best available search provider:
 *    - Tavily (if API key provided) - AI-optimized search
 *    - Serper (if API key provided) - Google results
 *    - Stagehand/Google (if browserbase available) - Bypasses blocks
 *    - Academic providers (Semantic Scholar, arXiv) - For research papers
 *
 * 2. Use the best available content extractor:
 *    - Stagehand (if browserbase available) - AI extraction, bypasses blocks
 *    - Firecrawl (if API key provided) - Fast API-based extraction
 *    - Playwright (always available) - May get blocked
 *
 * 3. Process through research phases:
 *    - Planning: Create research strategy
 *    - Searching: Find relevant sources
 *    - Analyzing: Extract and rate content
 *    - Synthesizing: Combine findings
 *    - Reporting: Generate final report
 */

/**
 * Configuration Tips:
 *
 * 1. For best results, use browserbase:
 *    - Bypasses most anti-bot measures
 *    - Handles CAPTCHAs automatically
 *    - Uses Google via Stagehand
 *
 * 2. For faster results without browserbase:
 *    - Use Tavily or Serper for search
 *    - Use Firecrawl for content extraction
 *
 * 3. The free tier (no API keys) still works:
 *    - Mock provider returns empty results
 *    - Playwright for extraction
 *    - Limited functionality but no errors
 */

/**
 * Search Providers:
 *    - Tavily (if API key present) - Best overall quality
 *    - Serper (if API key present) - Good alternative
 *    - Semantic Scholar (if API key present) - Academic papers
 *    - Fallback mock provider if none configured
 *
 * Content Extractors:
 *    - Stagehand/Browserbase (if service available) - Most reliable
 *    - Firecrawl (if API key present) - Good cloud option
 *    - Playwright (always available) - Local fallback, may get blocked
 *
 * Result Quality:
 *  3. Stagehand + Serper:
 *    - Uses Google via Serper
 *    - Browserbase for reliable extraction
 *  4. Playwright + Tavily:
 *    - Tavily for search
 *    - Playwright for extraction (may encounter blocks)
