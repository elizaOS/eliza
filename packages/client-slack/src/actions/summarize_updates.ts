export const summarizationTemplate = `Summarize progress updates from developers and professionals into a structured format, integrating both the new update and the existing summary to maintain continuity.

## Input Message:
{{user_message}}

## Existing Summary:
{{existing_summary}}

## Instructions:
Merge and Categorize Updates:
- Use the **existing summary** as the base and **integrate the new update** meaningfully.
- Retain continuity if the new update builds on an ongoing task.
- If a new task appears, introduce it as a separate section.

### Standardized Output Format:
- For each task, use the actual task name as the section heading.
  - DONE: Summarize completed work.
  - BLOCKERS FACED: Identify ongoing issues or blockers.
    - Mark as [RESOLVED] if fixed in "DONE".
    - Mark as [UNRESOLVED] if still pending.
  - IN PROGRESS: Ongoing work that isn't yet complete.
  - REMAINING: Summarize next steps from "NEXT" or other relevant entries.
    - If "NEXT" introduces a **new, unrelated** task, start a separate section.

### **Merging Logic:**
- **Update Existing Tasks:** If the new update continues an existing task, merge it seamlessly.
- **Track Progress:** Move items from "REMAINING" to "DONE" if completed.
- **Resolve Blockers:** If a blocker from the existing summary is resolved, move it to "DONE."
- **Add Missing Details:** If the new update introduces additional context to an existing task, incorporate it.

### **Formatting Guidelines:**
- Structure responses using '-' for points and indentation for sub-points. Avoid Markdown headers, bold, or special formatting.
- Mark a task as **[DONE]** only if **nothing meaningful remains** in "REMAINING."
- If a section has no content, exclude it.
- Keep summaries concise while preserving key technical details.
- **Do not infer missing details**â€”only summarize explicitly provided updates.

Ensure the final output reflects a **logically updated** and **comprehensive** summary that maintains task progression.
