};
```

### Character Definition

```typescript
const character: Character = {
  name: 'Eddy',
  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-anthropic',
    '@elizaos/plugin-openai',
    '@elizaos/plugin-discord',
    '@elizaos/plugin-telegram',
    '@elizaos/plugin-node',
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
  ],
  settings: {
    secrets: {
      DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID: process.env.DEV_SUPPORT_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID,
      DISCORD_API_TOKEN: process.env.DEV_SUPPORT_DISCORD_API_TOKEN,
      TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: process.env.DEV_SUPPORT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN,
    },
  },
};
```

## 4. Workflows

### Documentation Search

1. Receive developer question
2. Use RAG to search documentation
3. Generate contextual response
4. Provide relevant code examples
5. Track question for knowledge base

### Code Generation

````
Developer: How do I implement authentication using your SDK?

Eddy: I found some relevant documentation about authentication. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Auth } from '@your-sdk/auth';

const auth = new Auth({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  // Additional configuration
});

// Example authentication flow
async function authenticate() {
  try {
    const session = await auth.login({
      username: 'user@example.com',
      password: 'secure_password'
    });
    return session;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication failed:', error);
  }
}
````

This example shows the basic authentication flow. You'll need to:

1. Install the SDK: `npm install @your-sdk/auth`
2. Set up your API key in environment variables
3. Implement error handling for your use case

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail?

```

### Knowledge Extraction
1. Monitor chat discussions
2. Identify problem-solution patterns
3. Extract relevant code and context
4. Add to knowledge base with metadata
5. Link to related documentation

### Plugin Support Workflows

#### Plugin Introduction
```

Developer: I'm new to ElizaOS. What are plugins and how do they work?

Eddy: Plugins are modular components that extend agent capabilities in ElizaOS. They allow agents to:

1. Interact with external platforms (Discord, Telegram, etc.)
2. Connect to AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI)
3. Process specific types of data (SQL, PDF)
4. Handle media content (Video Understanding)

You can find all available plugins in the registry: https://elizaos.github.io/registry/

Plugins are specified in your agent's character definition:

```typescript
const character = {
  name: 'MyAgent',
  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-anthropic',
    '@elizaos/plugin-discord',
    // Other plugins
  ],
  // Rest of character definition
};
```

Would you like to know more about specific plugins or how to create your own?

```

#### Plugin Development Guidance
```

Developer: I want to build a plugin. What are the steps?

Eddy: To build an ElizaOS plugin:

1. Start with the template: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/v2-develop/packages/plugin-starter/src/index.ts

2. Develop in your own repository with this structure:

   - Define your plugin interface
   - Implement action handlers
   - Create comprehensive documentation

3. Test your plugin locally

4. When ready, submit a PR to the registry: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry

Here's a good example PR to follow: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/35

Is there a specific part of the process you need help with?

```

#### Plugin Selection Recommendation
```

Developer: Which plugins should I use for my customer support agent?

Eddy: For a customer support agent, I'd recommend:

1. Communication plugins:

   - @elizaos/plugin-discord (if supporting on Discord)
   - @elizaos/plugin-telegram (if supporting on Telegram)

2. AI reasoning:

   - @elizaos/plugin-anthropic or @elizaos/plugin-openai

3. Data handling:

   - @elizaos/plugin-pdf (if handling documents)
   - @elizaos/plugin-sql (if accessing database info)

4. Bootstrap:
   - @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap (for core utilities)

Do you have specific requirements for your support agent I should consider?

### Technical Support Workflows (New)

#### Troubleshooting Common Errors
```

Developer: I'm getting 'No TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered' error. How do I fix it?

Eddy: üõ†Ô∏è This error occurs when ElizaOS can't find an embedding model.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check your `.env` file has:

```
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-004
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Important: Anthropic plugin doesn't provide embeddings - include OpenAI plugin in your config

3Ô∏è‚É£ Plugin order matters - place OpenAI after Anthropic for proper fallback

4Ô∏è‚É£ Clear cache with `rm -rf ~/.eliza` and restart

Is there any specific part of your configuration you'd like me to help with?

```

#### Installation Guidance
```

Developer: How do I set up ElizaOS v2 beta?

Eddy: üöÄ Setting up ElizaOS v2 (beta):

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create project:

```bash
elizaos create
# or on Windows:
npx elizaos create
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Select database (pglite recommended for starting)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure `.env` with OpenAI key

5Ô∏è‚É£ Start server:

```bash
bun start
# or
elizaos start
```

Need help with any specific step?

```

#### Integration Support
```

Developer: How do I integrate ElizaOS with my frontend?

Eddy: üîå Integrating ElizaOS with custom frontend:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use the API endpoints in:
`packages/cli/src/server/api/agent.ts`

2Ô∏è‚É£ Key endpoint structure:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/agents/your-agent-id
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ For production:
‚Ä¢ Host ElizaOS CLI as a separate backend service
‚Ä¢ Configure CORS settings if needed
‚Ä¢ Use environment variables for configuration

4Ô∏è‚É£ Sample code:

```javascript
async function callAgent(message) {
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/agents/${agentId}/messages`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text: message }),
  });
  return await response.json();
}
```

Would you like me to explain any specific integration pattern?

```
