RLM Provider (Scaffold)

This module is a placeholder for integrating Recursive Language Models (RLM)
as an optional reasoning backend for Eliza v2.

Planned behavior:
- Eliza core remains responsible for memory, actions, and planning
- RLM acts as a drop-in reasoning layer / LLM provider
- Recursion is optional and configurable

This file intentionally contains no logic yet.
