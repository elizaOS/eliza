Let me gather information and provide a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## Debugging Approach\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n1. **Symptom Analysis** - What specific authentication behavior are you experiencing?\n2. **Environment Check** - Development vs production environment differences\n3. **Code Review** - Examine authentication middleware and token handling\n4. **Log Analysis** - Check server logs for error patterns and request flows\n\n## Common Authentication Issues & Solutions\n\n**JWT Token Problems:**\n```typescript\n// Check token expiration and format\nconst debugToken = (token: string) => {\n  try {\n    const decoded = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true });\n    console.log('Token header:', decoded?.header);\n    console.log('Token payload:', decoded?.payload);\n    console.log('Token expiry:', new Date(decoded?.payload.exp * 1000));\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Token decode error:', error.message);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Middleware Debugging:**\n```typescript\n// Enhanced authentication middleware with debugging\nconst authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {\n  console.log('Auth middleware - Headers:', req.headers);\n  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];\n  \n  if (!token) {\n    console.log('No token provided');\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });\n  }\n  \n  try {\n    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);\n    console.log('Token verified successfully:', decoded.userId);\n    req.user = decoded;\n    next();\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Token verification failed:', error.message);\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Immediate Debugging Steps:**\n\n1. **Enable Debug Logging**\n   - Add comprehensive logging to authentication flow\n   - Check token format and expiration\n   - Verify secret key consistency\n\n2. **Test Token Generation**\n   - Verify JWT secret is consistent across services\n   - Check token payload structure\n   - Validate expiration times\n\n3. **Client-Side Validation**\n   - Ensure tokens are stored and sent correctly\n   - Check for token refresh mechanisms\n   - Verify CORS and request headers\n\nCould you share:\n- The specific error messages you're seeing?\n- Your authentication middleware code?\n- Any relevant server logs?\n\nI'll create a comprehensive debugging script and solution based on your specific issue."
