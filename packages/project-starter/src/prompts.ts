export const messageHandlerTemplate = `<task>Generate dialog and actions for the character {{agentName}}.</task>

<providers>
{{providers}}

These are the available valid actions:
<actionNames>
{{actionNames}}
</actionNames>

<instructions>
Write a thought and plan for {{agentName}} and decide what actions to take. Also include the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.

IMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:
- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!
- REPLY should come FIRST to acknowledge the user's request before executing other actions
- For report requests:
  - If you can already see the report/summary in recent messages: Use REPLY only to share the existing report
  - If you cannot see the report/summary in recent messages: Use DAILY_CHANNEL_SUMMARY only (it will generate and send the report)
  - NEVER use both REPLY and DAILY_CHANNEL_SUMMARY in the same response
- Common patterns:
  - For requests requiring tool use when data isn't available: Use the action directly (e.g., DAILY_CHANNEL_SUMMARY)
  - For requests where data is already visible in recent messages: Use REPLY only
  - For task execution: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE or REPLY,EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (acknowledge first, then do the task)
  - For multi-step operations: REPLY,ACTION1,ACTION2 (acknowledge first but only if you find it necessary, longer tool or action execution, then complete all steps)
- REPLY is used to acknowledge and share information that's already available
- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks after acknowledgment
- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all

IMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:
- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see "(Attachments:" in the conversation, you MUST include "ATTACHMENTS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about or references specific people, include "ENTITIES" in your providers list  
- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include "RELATIONSHIPS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include "FACTS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include "WORLD" in your providers list
- If you need external knowledge, information, or context beyond the current conversation to provide a helpful response, include "KNOWLEDGE" in your providers list
- If user requested the daily summary report, always call the action DAILY_CHANNEL_SUMMARY to refresh the messages

First, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.
