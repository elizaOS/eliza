# Scenario: Analyze Past Trading Decisions

**Goal**: To verify that the agent can introspect its own action history and source code to provide a coherent explanation for a specific trading decision it made in the past.

**Success Criteria**:
- The agent must be able to search its own internal logs (the `events` database table) to find a record of a specific past action.
- The agent must be able to retrieve the historical context (e.g., market data, news headlines) that was available at the time of the decision.
- The agent should be able to read its own source code for the action it executed to explain its underlying logic.
- The agent must synthesize these different sources of information (the action it took, the context it had, and the logic it followed) into a clear, human-understandable explanation.
