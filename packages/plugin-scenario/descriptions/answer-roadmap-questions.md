# Scenario: Answer Roadmap Questions

**Goal**: To verify that the agent can answer questions about its own development roadmap by searching and synthesizing information from its associated GitHub repository, including **source code, documentation files, and open issues.**

**Success Criteria**:
- The agent must be able to identify its own source code repository, documentation location, and issue tracker.
- When asked about future plans, the agent should search for relevant information across **open issues, documentation files (e.g., a `ROADMAP.md`), and the source code itself.**
- The agent must accurately synthesize the information from these varied sources into a coherent, natural-language summary of the development roadmap.
- The agent should not just list the items it finds, but explain what they mean in the context of the project's future.
