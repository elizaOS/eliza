- **Status**: ✅ **6/6 scenarios passing**

### 4. Visual Tests (`npm run test:rpg`)
- **Purpose**: Tests visual rendering and 3D systems (requires full dev environment)
- **Coverage**: Browser automation, screenshot capture, entity color detection
- **Location**: `scripts/rpg-visual-test.mjs`
- **Status**: ⚠️ **Timeout handled gracefully** (requires development setup)

### 5. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Tests build process, linting, and system integration
- **Coverage**: ESLint, TypeScript compilation, build process
- **Status**: ✅ **Functional with warnings handled**

### 6. Performance Tests
- **Purpose**: Validates performance benchmarks and efficiency
- **Coverage**: Entity creation, component operations, system updates
- **Status**: ✅ **All benchmarks met**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all          # Comprehensive test runner
npm run test:comprehensive  # Full test suite with reporting
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
npm run test              # Basic structure validation
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:runtime      # Runtime validation tests
npm run test:rpg          # RPG visual tests (with timeout)
```

### Development Testing
```bash
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for unit tests
npm run test:coverage     # Coverage reporting
```
