### 🌐 View Your Models

Open the 3D viewer to see your real AI-generated models:
```
file:///Users/shawwalters/eliza-self/packages/hyperfy/src/rpg/data/real_3d_models/index.html
```

The viewer will now show **real 3D models** instead of green cubes!

### 📈 Next Steps

The generation script is continuing to run and will complete all 10 models. Each model takes approximately 2-3 minutes to generate via Meshy AI.

**Estimated completion time:** ~15-20 minutes for all remaining models.
