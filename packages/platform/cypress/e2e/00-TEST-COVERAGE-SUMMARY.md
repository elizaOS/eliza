## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Update tests when UI changes** - All data-cy attributes and selectors must be maintained
2. **Add new tests for new features** - Follow the established patterns and naming conventions
3. **Mock all external dependencies** - Ensure tests are deterministic and isolated
4. **Test error scenarios** - Every happy path should have corresponding error path tests
5. **Validate accessibility** - Include ARIA and keyboard navigation tests for new components
6. **Performance monitoring** - Add performance assertions for new interactive features

This comprehensive test suite ensures zero errors and complete coverage of all user-facing functionality in the ElizaOS Platform.
