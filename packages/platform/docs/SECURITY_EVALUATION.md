# Platform API Security Evaluation

## Executive Summary

The current API route security implementation is inconsistent and poses significant security risks. Only ~4% of routes currently implement security headers, leaving the platform vulnerable to common web attacks.

## Current State Analysis

### Security Coverage

- **Total API Routes**: ~100+
- **Routes with Security Headers**: 4 (security/\*, performance)
- **Routes without Security Headers**: 96+
- **Critical Unprotected Routes**: billing, api-keys, agents, organizations

### Security Headers Applied by `withSecurityHeaders`

When properly implemented, our security headers provide protection against:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

   - Prevents XSS attacks
   - Controls resource loading
   - Blocks inline scripts/styles (with exceptions)

2. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**

   - Forces HTTPS usage
   - Prevents protocol downgrade attacks
   - 1-year max-age with preload

3. **X-Frame-Options: DENY**

   - Prevents clickjacking attacks
   - Blocks iframe embedding

4. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**

   - Prevents MIME type sniffing
   - Blocks content type confusion attacks

5. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block**

   - Legacy XSS protection for older browsers
   - Blocks detected XSS attacks

6. **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin**

   - Controls referrer information leakage
   - Protects user privacy

7. **Permissions Policy**
   - Restricts browser features
   - Prevents unauthorized access to sensors/APIs

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Inconsistent Implementation

- Mixed patterns: `handleGET` vs direct `GET` exports
- No centralized security enforcement
- Developer confusion leading to omissions

### 2. Vulnerable Endpoints

High-risk routes without protection:

- `/api/billing/*` - Payment and credit card data
- `/api/api-keys/*` - API key generation/management
- `/api/agents/*` - Agent creation and control
- `/api/organizations/*` - Organization settings

### 3. Authentication Gaps

- No consistent auth enforcement
- Manual auth checks in each handler
- Risk of developers forgetting auth checks

## Proposed Solution

### Clean Architecture Approach

Instead of the "gross" handle pattern, we've implemented a route wrapper system:

```typescript
// Before (gross pattern)
async function handleGET(request) {
  /* ... */
}
async function handlePOST(request) {
  /* ... */
}
export const GET = withSecurityHeaders(handleGET);
export const POST = withSecurityHeaders(handlePOST);

// After (clean pattern)
async function handleGET(request) {
  /* ... */
}
async function handlePOST(request) {
  /* ... */
}
export const { GET, POST } = wrapHandlers({ handleGET, handlePOST });
```

### Benefits

1. **Automatic Security**: Headers applied by default
2. **Smart Auth**: Routes automatically get auth based on path
3. **Centralized Config**: Single source of truth for route security
4. **Clean Syntax**: No verbose exports
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

### Route Configuration System

```typescript
const ROUTE_OVERRIDES = {
  // Public routes (no auth)
  '/api/health': { requireAuth: false },
  '/api/auth/login': { requireAuth: false },

  // Admin routes
  '/api/security': { requireAdmin: true },
  '/api/metrics': { requireAdmin: true },

  // Authenticated routes
  '/api/agents': { requireAuth: true },
  '/api/billing': { requireAuth: true },
};
```

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Routes (Immediate)

1. Billing endpoints
2. API key management
3. Agent operations
4. Organization settings

### Phase 2: Admin Routes (Week 1)

1. Security configuration
2. Performance monitoring
3. Metrics and analytics
4. Audit logs

### Phase 3: Standard Routes (Week 2)

1. Character management
2. Marketplace operations
3. Dashboard endpoints
4. Storage APIs

### Phase 4: Public Routes (Week 3)

1. Health checks
2. Authentication flows
3. Anonymous endpoints
4. Documentation routes

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Default Secure

- All routes get security headers by default
- Authentication required unless explicitly public
- Logging enabled for audit trails

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

- Admin routes require admin role
- Organization data scoped to user's org
- API keys have limited permissions

### 3. Defense in Depth

- Security headers (first layer)
- Authentication checks (second layer)
- Authorization checks (third layer)
- Input validation (fourth layer)

### 4. Monitoring and Auditing

- All requests logged
- Security violations tracked
- CSP violations reported
- Performance metrics collected

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create `route-wrapper.ts` utility
- [x] Define route security configurations
- [x] Update critical billing routes
- [x] Update agent management routes
- [x] Update public health check routes
- [ ] Run migration script to identify remaining routes
- [ ] Update all remaining routes systematically
- [ ] Add security tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Document security patterns for developers
- [ ] Set up CSP violation monitoring

## Conclusion

The current "handle" pattern is indeed "gross" and error-prone. The new route wrapper system provides:

1. **Better Security**: Consistent header application
2. **Cleaner Code**: No verbose export patterns
3. **Developer Experience**: Simple, intuitive API
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration
5. **Compliance**: Meets security best practices

By implementing this system across all routes, we significantly improve the platform's security posture while making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
