# Test Coverage Recommendations

## Current Status

We've added test cases for all actions and providers in the codebase. However, many of these tests are failing due to insufficient mocking of the runtime environment.

## Issues Found

1. **Mock Runtime Inadequacy**: The mock runtime doesn't implement all required methods and properties that the real runtime has.
2. **Missing Method Mocks**: Many provider implementations rely on methods like `getConversationLength`, `getKnowledge`, etc. that aren't mocked.
3. **Validation Requirements**: Many action validate methods require specific states or conditions to return true.
4. **Complex Dependencies**: Some providers and actions have complex dependencies on runtime state.

## Recommendations for Improving Test Coverage

### For Actions:

1. Study each action's implementation to understand validation requirements
2. Create test-specific mock data that will pass validation
3. Enhance the mock runtime with all required methods that actions call
4. Test the full lifecycle of actions, including side effects

### For Providers:

1. Create a more comprehensive mock runtime with all provider-specific methods
2. Mock required runtime properties like `runtime.providers`, `runtime.evaluators`, etc.
3. Create test-specific return values for each provider
4. Test both successful and error paths

### General Improvements:

1. Consider using a testing library for creating mocks (like `jest-mock-extended`)
2. Create test fixtures for common test data
3. Implement factory functions for generating test-specific runtimes
4. Consider integration tests that use a simplified but real runtime

## Implementation Plan

1. Focus first on fixing the core functionality tests (plugin.test.ts, logic.test.ts)
2. Then implement individual action tests, starting with the most critical ones
3. Finally, implement provider tests

By systematically addressing these issues, we can achieve comprehensive test coverage for the plugin-bootstrap package.
