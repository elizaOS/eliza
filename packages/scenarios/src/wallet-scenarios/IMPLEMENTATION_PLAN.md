# Wallet Scenarios Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for 10 comprehensive wallet scenarios that test EVM and Solana integration across various DeFi protocols and services.

## Missing Components Analysis

### Required Plugins
1. **plugin-defi-aggregator** - For finding best yields across protocols
2. **plugin-bridge** - For cross-chain asset bridging (Wormhole, Hop, Synapse)
3. **plugin-dex-aggregator** - For finding best swap routes
4. **plugin-nft-trading** - For NFT marketplace interactions
5. **plugin-options** - For options trading (Lyra, etc.)
6. **plugin-lending** - For lending protocol interactions
7. **plugin-governance** - Enhanced governance with bribing support
8. **plugin-perpetuals** - For perps trading (dYdX, GMX, Drift)
9. **plugin-mev-protection** - For private mempool transactions
10. **plugin-monitoring** - For price feeds and monitoring

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. Enhance existing EVM plugin with lending and LP operations
2. Enhance existing Solana plugin with lending and liquid staking
3. Create plugin-bridge for cross-chain operations
4. Create plugin-monitoring for price feeds

### Phase 2: DeFi Protocols (Week 2)
1. Create plugin-lending with Aave, Compound, Radiant, Solend
2. Create plugin-defi-aggregator for yield optimization
3. Enhance EVM plugin with Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity

### Phase 3: Advanced Trading (Week 3)
1. Create plugin-perpetuals for derivatives trading
2. Create plugin-options for options strategies
3. Create plugin-dex-aggregator for optimal routing
4. Create plugin-nft-trading for NFT operations

### Phase 4: MEV & Governance (Week 4)
1. Implement MEV protection across all trading actions
2. Enhance governance plugin with bribing support
3. Add social trading features
4. Complete monitoring and analytics

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each action in isolation
- Mock external API calls
- Validate parameter handling

### Integration Tests
- Test cross-plugin interactions
- Test actual testnet transactions
- Validate error handling

### End-to-End Tests
- Run full scenarios on testnet
- Verify transaction success
- Validate final states

### Performance Tests
- Measure response times
- Test concurrent operations
- Validate gas optimization

## Scenario Implementation Order

1. **Scenario 7**: Multi-Protocol Lending Optimization (tests lending plugin)
2. **Scenario 3**: Leveraged Farming Strategy (tests lending + bridge + LP)
3. **Scenario 1**: DeFi Yield Optimization (tests aggregator + bridge)
4. **Scenario 8**: MEV Protection Trading (tests MEV + DEX aggregator)
5. **Scenario 6**: Social Trading Mirror (tests monitoring + copy trading)
6. **Scenario 2**: NFT Arbitrage Bot (tests NFT + bridge + monitoring)
7. **Scenario 5**: Options Strategy (tests options + bridge + aggregator)
8. **Scenario 10**: Cross-Chain Perpetuals (tests perps + monitoring)
9. **Scenario 4**: Gaming & DeFi Combo (tests gaming integration + bridge)
10. **Scenario 9**: Governance Mining (tests enhanced governance + bridge)

## Success Criteria

1. All scenarios execute successfully on testnet
2. Gas costs are optimized and reasonable
3. Error handling is comprehensive
4. Performance meets benchmarks
5. Security best practices are followed
6. Documentation is complete
