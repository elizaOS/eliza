Initial Report:
Users are being logged out after 5 minutes instead of the configured 30 minutes. 
The issue started after the recent deployment of v2.1.3.
Logs show: "Token validation failed: expired" but timestamps suggest tokens should still be valid.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to application
2. Wait 5-10 minutes without activity  
3. Attempt to access protected resource
4. Observe premature logout

Expected: Token should remain valid for 30 minutes
Actual: Token expires after ~5 minutes

Environment: Node.js 18, JWT tokens, Redis session store, production load balancer`,
