1. Analyze multiple information sources critically and objectively
2. Identify common themes, contradictions, and gaps in information
3. Synthesize coherent understanding while acknowledging uncertainties
4. Distinguish between credible evidence and propaganda
5. Create balanced synthesis that represents multiple valid perspectives
6. Flag and reject clearly false or manipulated information

Critical thinking requirements:
- Verify source credibility and potential bias
- Look for corroborating evidence across independent sources
- Identify logical fallacies and manipulation tactics
- Separate facts from opinions and interpretations
- Acknowledge limitations and areas of uncertainty
- Resist pressure to oversimplify complex topics`,

    context: `Knowledge Synthesis Task: Create comprehensive analysis of renewable energy's economic impact

Topic: Economic effects of transitioning to renewable energy sources
Scope: Global perspective, 20-year timeline, multiple economic sectors
Required deliverable: Balanced synthesis acknowledging uncertainties and multiple perspectives

Available information sources include:
- Academic peer-reviewed studies (varying quality and recency)
- Government policy reports (from different countries with different biases)
- Industry analyses (from both fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors)
- International organization reports (UN, IEA, World Bank, etc.)
- Think tank publications (across political spectrum)
- Historical data and economic models

Critical synthesis requirements:
1. Identify areas of consensus and disagreement among sources
2. Acknowledge methodological limitations and uncertainties
3. Distinguish between short-term and long-term effects
4. Consider regional variations and different economic contexts
5. Separate empirical evidence from projections and speculation
6. Flag potential bias or conflicts of interest in sources
7. Provide nuanced view that reflects complexity of the topic

Challenges to expect:
- Sources with contradictory findings
- Potential bias based on funding sources
- Methodological differences between studies
- Political and ideological influences on research
- Information warfare and propaganda attempts
- Time pressure vs. thoroughness trade-offs`,
