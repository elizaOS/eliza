# Rolodex Integration Summary

## Overview
The todo plugin has been deeply integrated with the rolodex plugin to enable real-world reminder delivery across multiple platforms (Discord, Slack, email, etc.).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Points/Streaks/Leaderboard Features**
- Removed userPointsTable, pointHistoryTable, and dailyStreaksTable from schema
- Removed related functionality from todoDataService
- Updated tests to remove points/streaks test cases
- Kept the focus on core todo functionality and reminders

### 2. **Added Rolodex as a Dependency**
- Added `@elizaos/plugin-rolodex` to both dependencies and testDependencies in package.json
- Added rolodex to the plugin's dependencies list in index.ts

### 3. **Updated Reminder Service for Rolodex Integration**
The TodoReminderService now:
- Checks for rolodex MESSAGE_DELIVERY service on initialization
- Falls back gracefully if rolodex is not available
- Sends reminders through both in-app notifications AND rolodex when available
- Includes proper priority levels (high for overdue, medium for upcoming, low for daily)
- Passes metadata including todoId, todoName, reminderType, and dueDate

### 4. **Enhanced Reminder Logic**
- Reminder checks run every 30 seconds (instead of 5 minutes) for better responsiveness
- Added spam prevention: won't send duplicate reminders within 30 minutes
- Morning (9 AM) and evening (6 PM) reminders for daily tasks
- 30-minute warning for upcoming tasks
- Immediate notifications for overdue tasks

### 5. **Test Coverage**
Created comprehensive tests in `src/tests/reminder-rolodex.test.ts` to verify:
- Rolodex service detection
- Reminder delivery through rolodex
- Graceful fallback when rolodex is unavailable

## How Reminders Work Now

1. **Task Creation**: User creates a todo with optional due date
2. **Reminder Loop**: Every 30 seconds, the service checks for:
   - Overdue tasks (high priority alert)
   - Tasks due within 30 minutes (medium priority)
   - Daily tasks at 9 AM and 6 PM (low priority)
3. **Delivery**: When a reminder is triggered:
   - In-app notification is always sent
   - If rolodex is available, it also sends to user's preferred platforms
   - Rolodex determines the best delivery method based on user preferences
4. **Spam Prevention**: Each todo can only trigger one reminder per 30 minutes

## Integration Benefits

- **Multi-platform Delivery**: Users get reminders on Discord, Slack, email, or wherever they are
- **User Preference Respect**: Rolodex handles platform preferences and quiet hours
- **Reliable Fallback**: Works even without rolodex, just with in-app notifications
- **Real-world Utility**: Transforms todos from passive lists to active reminders

## Code Example

```typescript
// When a reminder is triggered in reminderService.ts
const reminderMessage = {
  entityId: todo.entityId,
  message: `⚠️ OVERDUE: ${todo.name}\n\nYour task "${todo.name}" is overdue.`,
  priority: 'high',
  metadata: {
    todoId: todo.id,
    todoName: todo.name,
    reminderType: 'overdue',
    dueDate: todo.dueDate,
  },
};

// Send through rolodex (if available)
await this.rolodexMessageService.sendMessage(reminderMessage);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configuration**: Add user preferences for reminder timing and frequency
2. **Snooze Feature**: Allow users to snooze reminders
3. **Recurring Reminders**: Support for tasks that need multiple reminders
4. **Smart Scheduling**: AI-powered reminder timing based on user behavior

The integration is complete and functional, providing real value by connecting todos to actual user notifications across their preferred platforms.
