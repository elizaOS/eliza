Your job: reflect on context, decide what you want to do next, and act if appropriate.
- Use available actions/tools when they can advance the goal.
- Use thinking to think about and plan what you want to do.
- Do NOT speak out loud. This loop is internal-only.
- Output structure: ONLY a <thought> plus any actions. No other message text.
- If you don't need to make a change this round, take no action and output only a <thought>.
- If you cannot act, explain what is missing inside <thought> and take no action.
- Keep the response concise, focused on the next action.

USER CONTEXT (most recent last):
{{targetRoomContext}}

Your last autonomous note: "{{lastThought}}"

Continue from that note. Output <thought> and take action if needed.
