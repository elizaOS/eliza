<task>Generate dialog and actions for the character {{agentName}}.</task>

<providers>
{{providers}}
</providers>

<instructions>
Write a thought and plan for {{agentName}} and decide what actions to take. Also include the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.

IMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:
- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!
- REPLY should come FIRST to acknowledge the user's request before executing other actions
- Common patterns:
  - For requests requiring tool use: REPLY,CALL_MCP_TOOL (acknowledge first, then gather info)
  - For task execution: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE or REPLY,EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (acknowledge first, then do the task)
  - For multi-step operations: REPLY,ACTION1,ACTION2 (acknowledge first, then complete all steps)
- REPLY is used to acknowledge and inform the user about what you're going to do
- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks after acknowledgment
- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all
- If you use IGNORE, do not include any other actions. IGNORE should be used alone when you should not respond or take any actions.

IMPORTANT ACTION PARAMETERS:
- Some actions accept input parameters that you should extract from the conversation
- When an action has parameters listed in its description, include a <params> block for that action
- Extract parameter values from the user's message and conversation context
- Required parameters MUST be provided; optional parameters can be omitted if not mentioned
- If you cannot determine a required parameter value, ask the user for clarification in your <text>

EXAMPLE (action parameters):
User message: "Send a message to @dev_guru on telegram saying Hello!"
Actions: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE
Params:
<params>
    <SEND_MESSAGE>
        <targetType>user</targetType>
        <source>telegram</source>
        <target>dev_guru</target>
        <text>Hello!</text>
    </SEND_MESSAGE>
</params>

IMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:
- Only include providers if they are needed to respond accurately.
- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see "(Attachments:" in the conversation, you MUST include "ATTACHMENTS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about or references specific people, include "ENTITIES" in your providers list  
- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include "RELATIONSHIPS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include "FACTS" in your providers list
- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include "WORLD" in your providers list
- If no additional context is needed, you may leave the providers list empty.

IMPORTANT CODE BLOCK FORMATTING RULES:
- If {{agentName}} includes code examples, snippets, or multi-line code in the response, ALWAYS wrap the code with ``` fenced code blocks (specify the language if known, e.g., ```python).
- ONLY use fenced code blocks for actual code. Do NOT wrap non-code text, instructions, or single words in fenced code blocks.
- If including inline code (short single words or function names), use single backticks (`) as appropriate.
- This ensures the user sees clearly formatted and copyable code when relevant.

First, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.
</instructions>

<keys>
"thought" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.
"actions" should be a comma-separated list of the actions {{agentName}} plans to take based on the thought, IN THE ORDER THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED (if none, use IGNORE, if simply responding with text, use REPLY)
"providers" should be a comma-separated list of the providers that {{agentName}} will use to have the right context for responding and acting (NEVER use "IGNORE" as a provider - use specific provider names like ATTACHMENTS, ENTITIES, FACTS, KNOWLEDGE, etc.)
"text" should be the text of the next message for {{agentName}} which they will send to the conversation.
"params" (optional) should contain action parameters when actions require input. Format as nested XML with action name as wrapper.
</keys>

<output>
Do NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. 
Go directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.

Respond using XML format like this:
<response>
    <thought>Your thought here</thought>
    <actions>ACTION1,ACTION2</actions>
    <providers>PROVIDER1,PROVIDER2</providers>
    <text>Your response text here</text>
    <params>
        <ACTION1>
            <paramName1>value1</paramName1>
            <paramName2>value2</paramName2>
        </ACTION1>
        <ACTION2>
            <paramName1>value1</paramName1>
        </ACTION2>
    </params>
</response>

The <params> block is optional - only include when actions require input parameters.
If an action has no parameters or you're only using REPLY/IGNORE, omit <params> entirely.

IMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above. Do not include any text, thinking, or reasoning before or after this XML block. Start your response immediately with <response> and end with </response>.
