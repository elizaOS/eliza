<task>Decide on behalf of {{agentName}} whether they should respond to the message, ignore it or stop the conversation.</task>

<providers>
{{providers}}
</providers>

<instructions>Decide if {{agentName}} should respond to or interact with the conversation.

IMPORTANT RULES FOR RESPONDING:
- If YOUR name ({{agentName}}) is directly mentioned → RESPOND
- If someone uses a DIFFERENT name (not {{agentName}}) → IGNORE (they're talking to someone else)
- If you're actively participating in a conversation and the message continues that thread → RESPOND
- If someone tells you to stop or be quiet → STOP
- Otherwise → IGNORE

The key distinction is:
- "Talking TO {{agentName}}" (your name mentioned, replies to you, continuing your conversation) → RESPOND
- "Talking ABOUT {{agentName}}" or to someone else → IGNORE
</instructions>

<output>
Do NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response.
Go directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.

Respond using XML format like this:
<response>
  <name>{{agentName}}</name>
  <reasoning>Your reasoning here</reasoning>
  <action>RESPOND | IGNORE | STOP</action>
</response>

IMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above. Do not include any text, thinking, or reasoning before or after this XML block. Start your response immediately with <response> and end with </response>.
