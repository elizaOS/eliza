# AgentKit Plugin Cleanup Summary

## Files Deleted
1. `/src/services/RealCustodialWalletService.ts` - Duplicate custodial wallet service with database persistence
2. `/src/database/schema.ts` - Unused database schema only referenced by RealCustodialWalletService
3. `/src/trust/RealTrustIntegration.ts` - Mock trust integration only used by RealCustodialWalletService
4. `/src/index-improved.ts` - Alternative entry point that used the Real services
5. `/src/__tests__/e2e/real-integration.test.ts` - Tests for the deleted Real services

## Files Updated
1. `/src/api/walletRoutes.ts`
   - Changed import from `RealCustodialWalletService` to `CustodialWalletService`
   - Changed import from `RealTrustIntegration` to `trustIntegration` 
   - Updated service references from `"real-custodial-wallet"` to `"custodial-wallet"`
   - Replaced `RealTrustValidator.validateTrustLevel()` and `RealTrustValidator.assessTransactionRisk()` calls with:
     - Direct trust level calculation using trust-engine service
     - `HighValueTransactionValidator.validateTransactionValue()` for transaction risk assessment

2. `/src/routes.ts`
   - Added import for `custodialWalletRoutes`
   - Added custodial wallet routes to the exported agentKitRoutes array

## Result
- Successfully removed all duplicate and broken services
- Kept only the `CustodialWalletService` as the single custodial service
- Updated all references to use the correct services
- Plugin builds successfully without errors
- No remaining references to deleted services in the codebase
