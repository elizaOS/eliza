API Endpoints:\n   - GET /api/todos - List all todos\n   - POST /api/todos - Create new todo\n   - PUT /api/todos/:id - Update todo\n   - DELETE /api/todos/:id - Delete todo\n\n3. Features:\n   - Input validation with express-validator\n   - Error handling middleware\n   - CORS configuration\n   - Basic authentication ready\n\nShall I start implementing the Express.js server?"
