# `@elizaos/agent`

Standalone elizaOS agent and HTTP backend. Plugin routes can be registered on `AgentRuntime` and are served by the agent’s HTTP stack.

## Documentation

- **Paid HTTP routes (webhooks, plugins):** see the docs site section on [webhooks and routes](https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/webhooks-and-routes).
- **x402 micropayments on plugin routes:** configured through the runtime's `x402` config block and the `X402_API_KEY` environment variable (see `packages/agent/src/runtime/eliza.ts`).

## Local development

From this package:

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun run test
```

See `package.json` for `build`, `lint`, and other scripts.

## Research tasks

`ResearchTaskExecutor` requires a provider registered for
`ModelType.RESEARCH`. Provider absence, rejection, or an empty report returns an
unsuccessful `TaskResult` with a stable `errorCode`; it never falls back to
ordinary `TEXT_LARGE` synthesis and labels that output as research.

## Message-interaction session persistence

`FileMessageInteractionSessionStore` is the durable single-host adapter for
core's message-interaction session authority. It serializes independent local
processes, writes a 0600 regular file through same-filesystem fsync and atomic
rename, fails fast on corruption and symlinks, recovers only stale locks whose
owner is no longer alive, and exposes explicit expiry collection. Its boundary
is one machine and one state directory. Multi-host deployments must supply a
transactional database implementation of `MessageInteractionSessionStore` and
use the session replay key as the effect or outbox idempotency key.

The bundled `eliza` plugin registers `MessageInteractionHostService` as the one
runtime authority connectors resolve through `MESSAGE_INTERACTION_HOST_SERVICE`.
Connectors submit capability profiles and trusted render bindings to `prepare`,
then send authenticated inbound provider receipts to `consume`. Only host-owned
effect handlers execute retained operations; completed receipts preserve the
provider event, canonical inbound event, audit id, and app-state proof for replay.

## Approval-bound plugin installation

`installPlugin` always installs the canonical npm package declared by the
registry (`plugin.npm.package`), even when lookup used a display name or alias.
Existing callers may continue passing a version string as the third argument.
Security-sensitive callers can instead bind the package and exact version they
showed an operator for approval:

```ts
const result = await installPlugin("friendly-registry-alias", undefined, {
  expected: {
    packageName: "@vendor/canonical-plugin",
    version: "2.4.1",
  },
});
```

The installer rejects a changed package or version before creating the install
directory or executing a package manager. A bound install uses that exact npm
package/version and does not silently fall back to a local workspace or moving
Git branch. Successful results include `provenance` identifying the actual
`local`, `npm`, or `git` source. npm/Bun lock integrity and resolved tarball
metadata are returned when available; unavailable integrity stays `null`, and
Git installs report the cloned commit.

## x402 at a glance

Paid routes set `x402` on a `Route`. The middleware returns **402** with payment options and accepts on-chain proofs, facilitator payment IDs, or standard payment payloads (`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` / `X-Payment`), then verifies and settles through a facilitator before running the handler.
