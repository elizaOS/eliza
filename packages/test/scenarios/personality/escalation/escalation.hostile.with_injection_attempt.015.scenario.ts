 * Personality benchmark — bucket: escalation

 * Ladder of escalation requests ('more_blunt', direction: blunt). Agent's tone/responsiveness should shift monotonically with each escalation step, and the new level should hold across the probe turns that follow.

 * This scenario is purely declarative. No actions are required; no plugin seed
 * is needed. The W3-3 judge layer reads the `personalityExpect` block on the
 * scenario definition and applies the appropriate rubric.
