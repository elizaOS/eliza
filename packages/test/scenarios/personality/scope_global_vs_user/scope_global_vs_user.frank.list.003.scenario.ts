/**
 * Personality benchmark — bucket: scope_global_vs_user
 * Scenario id: scope_global_vs_user.frank.list.003
 *
 * Two-room response-consistency case for variant 'admin_global_formal_user_casual'. The live judge evaluates only apparent reply behavior across labeled contexts; it does not establish roles, authorization, or durable state isolation.

 * This live-model behavior case executes its explicit `judgeRubric` final
 * check. `personalityExpect` is inventory metadata and is not a separate
 * runner assertion; structural PERSONALITY state contracts live beside this corpus.
