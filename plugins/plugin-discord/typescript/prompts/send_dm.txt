1. The recipient they want to message (could be a username, user ID, or mentioned user)
2. The message content they want to send

Extract the recipient identifier and the message content from their request.
- If they mention a user like @username or <@userid>, extract that
- If they provide a username or display name, extract that
- If they provide a user ID (long number), extract that
- Extract the complete message they want to send

Your response must be formatted as a JSON block with this structure:
```json
{
  "recipientIdentifier": "<username|user-id|@mention>",
  "messageContent": "<the message to send>"
}
```
