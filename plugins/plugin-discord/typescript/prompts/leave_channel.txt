# Instructions: {{senderName}} is requesting the bot to leave a specific Discord channel (text or voice). Your goal is to determine which channel they want to leave.

Extract the channel identifier from their request:
- If they mention a channel like #general or <#channelid>, extract that
- If they provide a channel name (like "dev-voice" or "general"), extract just the name
- If they provide a channel ID (long number), extract that
- If they say "this channel" or "here", use "current"
- If they don't specify a channel but mention "voice", "vc", use "current" and mark as voice

Examples:
- "leave the dev-voice channel" -> channelIdentifier: "dev-voice", isVoiceChannel: true
- "leave #general" -> channelIdentifier: "general", isVoiceChannel: false
- "leave voice" -> channelIdentifier: "current", isVoiceChannel: true
- "stop listening to this channel" -> channelIdentifier: "current", isVoiceChannel: false

Your response must be formatted as a JSON block with this structure:
```json
{
  "channelIdentifier": "<actual-channel-name-or-id-or-current>",
  "isVoiceChannel": true/false
}
```
