# Instructions: {{senderName}} is requesting the bot to join a specific Discord channel (text or voice). Your goal is to determine which channel they want to join.

Extract the channel identifier from their request:
- If they mention a channel like #general or <#channelid>, extract that
- If they provide a channel name, extract that
- If they provide a channel ID (long number), extract that
- If they mention "voice", "vc", "voice channel", include that as a hint

Your response must be formatted as a JSON block with this structure:
```json
{
  "channelIdentifier": "<channel-name|channel-id|#mention>",
  "isVoiceChannel": true/false
}
```
