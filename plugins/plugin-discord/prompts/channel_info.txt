# Messages we are searching for channel information
{{recentMessages}}

# Instructions: {{senderName}} is requesting to read messages from a specific Discord channel. Your goal is to determine:
1. The channel they want to read from (could be the current channel or a mentioned channel)
2. How many messages they want to read (default to 10 if not specified)
3. Whether they want a summary or just the messages
4. If they're looking for messages from a specific person

If they say "this channel" or "here", use the current channel.
If they mention a specific channel name or ID, extract that.
If they ask to "summarize" or mention what someone is "talking about", set summarize to true.

Your response must be formatted as a JSON block with this structure:
```json
{
  "channelIdentifier": "<current|channel-name|channel-id>",
  "messageCount": <number between 1 and 50>,
  "summarize": true/false,
  "focusUser": "<username or null>"
}
```
