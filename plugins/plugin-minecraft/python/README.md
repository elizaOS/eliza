# Minecraft Plugin for ElizaOS (Python)

Python client for the ElizaOS Minecraft Mineflayer bridge.

This package **does not run Mineflayer** itself; it connects to the local bridge server started by the TypeScript plugin (or started manually).

See the root docs:

- `plugins/plugin-minecraft/README.md`
