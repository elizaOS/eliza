## Instructions
Parse the user's message to extract information for creating a new goal.
Determine if this goal is for the agent itself or for tracking a user's goal.

Goals should be long-term achievable objectives, not short-term tasks.

<response>
  <name>A clear, concise name for the goal</name>
  <description>Optional detailed description</description>
  <ownerType>Either "agent" (for agent's own goals) or "entity" (for user's goals)</ownerType>
</response>

If the message doesn't clearly indicate a goal to create, return empty response.

## Example Output Format
<response>
  <name>Learn Spanish fluently</name>
  <description>Achieve conversational fluency in Spanish within 6 months</description>
  <ownerType>entity</ownerType>
</response>
