/**
 * Leaf metadata for CALENDAR's nested planner arguments. Both the calendar
 * action and its PA host wrapper import this module directly so action-schema
 * construction cannot depend on either plugin's runtime registration cycle.
 *
 * Two surfaces live here, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 * - CALENDAR_DETAILS_PARAMETER_SCHEMA is what the planner SEES: one canonical
 *   key per concept with a short imperative description. Live 2026-09-13 the
 *   previous 99-key surface (every camel/snake/lower spelling of every field
 *   plus connector control flags) rendered ~10.7k characters per planner call
 *   and the 27B planner filled most of it with debris: "4pm" as location,
 *   neighbouring key names as values ("grantId" in departure_address), a
 *   placeholder guest with notifyAttendees on a built-in event.
 * - CALENDAR_DETAIL_ALIASES is what the handler ACCEPTS: the historical
 *   spellings, folded onto their canonical key by normalizeCalendarDetails in
 *   actions/calendar-handler.ts for direct callers, replayed requests and the
 *   calendar's own extractor output. Core's validateToolArgs closes the
 *   details object, so an alias is never added back to the planner schema: a
 *   planner that still emits one gets `Unexpected argument 'details.<alias>'`
 *   and the planner loop retries with the declared key.
 */

/**
 * Handler-canonical detail key to accepted alternate spellings. Lookup is
 * case- and separator-insensitive (normalizeLookupKey), so `start_time`,
 * `startTime` and `STARTTIME` all fold onto `startAt`. `start`/`end` are the
 * planner-facing names; `startAt`/`endAt` remain the handler's own.
