# TASK: Select the Most Appropriate Tool and Server

You must select the most appropriate tool from the list above to fulfill the user's request. Your response must be a valid JSON object with the required properties.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
1. Provide both "serverName" and "toolName" from the options listed above.
2. Each name must match EXACTLY as shown in the list:
   - Example (correct): "serverName": "github"
   - Example (incorrect): "serverName": "GitHub", "Github", or variations
3. Extract ACTUAL parameter values from the conversation context.
   - Do not invent or use placeholders like "octocat" or "Hello-World" unless the user said so.
4. Include a "reasoning" field explaining why the selected tool fits the request.
5. If no tool is appropriate, respond with:
   {
     "noToolAvailable": true
   }

!!! YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE A VALID JSON OBJECT ONLY !!! 

CRITICAL: Your response must START with { and END with }. DO NOT include ANY text before or after the JSON.

## STRICT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- The response MUST be a single valid JSON object.
- DO NOT wrap the JSON in triple backticks (```), code blocks, or include any explanatory text.
- DO NOT include comments (// or /* */) anywhere.
- DO NOT use placeholders (e.g., "replace with...", "example", "your...", etc.)
- ALL strings must use double quotes.

## CRITICAL NOTES
- All values must be fully grounded in user input or inferred contextually.
- No missing fields unless they are explicitly optional in the schema.
- All types must match the schema (strings, numbers, booleans).

## JSON OBJECT STRUCTURE
Your response MUST contain ONLY these top-level keys:
1. "serverName" — The name of the server (e.g., "github", "notion")
2. "toolName" — The name of the tool (e.g., "get_file_contents", "search")
3. "reasoning" — A string explaining how the values were inferred from the conversation.
4. "noToolAvailable" — A boolean indicating if no tool is available (true/false)

## EXAMPLE RESPONSE
{
  "serverName": "github",
  "toolName": "get_file_contents",
  "reasoning": "The user wants to retrieve the README from the facebook/react repository.",
  "noToolAvailable": false
}

## REMINDERS
- Use "github" as serverName for GitHub tools.
- Use "notion" as serverName for Notion tools.
- For search and knowledge-based tasks, MCP tools are often appropriate.

REMEMBER: This output will be parsed directly as JSON. If the format is incorrect, the operation will fail.
