# TASK: Generate a Strictly Valid JSON Object for Tool Execution

You have chosen the "{{toolSelectionName.toolName}}" tool from the "{{toolSelectionName.serverName}}" server to address the user's request.
The reasoning behind this selection is: "{{toolSelectionName.reasoning}}"

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
1. Ensure the "toolArguments" object strictly adheres to the structure and requirements defined in the schema.
2. All parameter values must be extracted from the conversation context and must be concrete, usable values.
3. Avoid placeholders or generic terms unless explicitly provided by the user.

!!! YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE A VALID JSON OBJECT ONLY !!! 

## STRICT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- The response MUST be a single valid JSON object.
- DO NOT wrap the JSON in triple backticks (```), code blocks, or include any explanatory text.
- DO NOT include comments (// or /* */) anywhere.
- DO NOT use placeholders (e.g., "replace with...", "example", "your...", etc.)
- ALL strings must use double quotes

## CRITICAL NOTES
- All values must be fully grounded in user input or inferred contextually.
- No missing fields unless they are explicitly optional in the schema.
- All types must match the schema (strings, numbers, booleans).

## JSON OBJECT STRUCTURE
Your response MUST contain ONLY these two top-level keys:
1. "toolArguments" — An object matching the input schema: {{toolInputSchema}}
2. "reasoning" — A string explaining how the values were inferred from the conversation.

## EXAMPLE RESPONSE
{
  "toolArguments": {
    "owner": "facebook",
    "repo": "react",
    "path": "README.md",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "reasoning": "The user wants to see the README from the facebook/react repository based on our conversation."
}

REMEMBER: Your response will be parsed directly as JSON. If it fails to parse, the operation will fail completely.
