# Instructions: Write the next message for {{agentName}}. Include the appropriate action from the list: {{actionNames}}
Response format should be formatted in a valid JSON block like this:
```json
{ "thought": "<string>", "name": "{{agentName}}", "text": "<string>", "action": "<string>" }
```

The "action" field should be one of the options in [Available Actions] and the "text" field should be the response you want to send. Do not including any thinking or internal reflection in the "text" field. "thought" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about before responding, inlcuding a brief justification for the response.
