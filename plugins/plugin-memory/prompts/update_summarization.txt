# Task: Update and Condense Conversation Summary

You are updating an existing conversation summary with new messages, while keeping the total summary concise.

# Existing Summary
{{existingSummary}}

# Existing Topics
{{existingTopics}}

# New Messages Since Last Summary
{{newMessages}}

# Instructions
Update the summary by:
1. Merging the existing summary with insights from the new messages
2. Removing redundant or less important details to stay under the token limit
3. Keeping the most important context and decisions
4. Adding new topics if they emerge
5. **CRITICAL**: Keep the ENTIRE updated summary under 2500 tokens

The goal is a rolling summary that captures the essence of the conversation without growing indefinitely.
