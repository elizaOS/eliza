# `@elizaos/plugin-personal-assistant`

LifeOps is the elizaOS app that runs the user's day: routines, goals,
calendar, email, messaging, follow-ups with people, blockers, watchers, and
the operational glue around them. This README is the architecture summary
for contributors.

## Scheduled items, not generic tasks

Every reminder, check-in, follow-up, watcher, recap, approval surface, and
nag-the-user-when-they-go-quiet flow is a **LifeOps scheduled item** stored
as a `ScheduledTask` record and owned by the runner at
`plugins/plugin-scheduling/src/scheduled-task/runner.ts` (the personal-assistant
side wires it in via `src/lifeops/scheduled-task/{service,scheduler,runtime-wiring}.ts`).
There is no second LifeOps scheduling mechanism.

`ScheduledTask` is intentionally not the repository-wide "task" primitive.
Core runtime tasks are persisted `Task` rows handled by `TaskService`; coding
agent work is orchestrator/task-coordinator state; project and feature tasks
may have their own plugin-owned records. LifeOps integrates with those
surfaces through public plugin/runtime contracts instead of importing or
owning them as LifeOps primitives.

The shape:

```ts
interface ScheduledTask {
  taskId: string;
  kind: "reminder" | "checkin" | "followup" | "approval" | "recap" | "watcher" | "output" | "custom";
  promptInstructions: string;
  contextRequest?: { /* owner facts, entities, relationships, recent task states, event payload */ };
  trigger: /* once | cron | interval | relative_to_anchor | during_window | event | manual | after_task */;
  priority: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  shouldFire?: { compose: "all" | "any" | "first_deny"; gates: Array<{ kind: string; params? }> };
  completionCheck?: { kind: string; params?: ...; followupAfterMinutes? };
  escalation?: { ladderKey?: string; steps?: EscalationStep[] };
  output?: { destination: ...; target?: string; persistAs?: ... };
  pipeline?: { onComplete?, onSkip?, onFail? };
  subject?: { kind: "entity" | "relationship" | "thread" | "document" | "calendar_event" | "self"; id: string };
  idempotencyKey?: string;
  respectsGlobalPause: boolean;
  state: ScheduledTaskState;
  source: "default_pack" | "user_chat" | "first_run" | "plugin";
  createdBy: string;
  ownerVisible: boolean;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

The runner pattern-matches **only** on the structural fields above
(`kind`, `trigger`, `shouldFire`, `completionCheck`, `pipeline`, `output`,
`subject`, `priority`, `respectsGlobalPause`). It never inspects
`promptInstructions` content. This is non-negotiable.

The frozen contract is defined in `src/lifeops/scheduled-task/types.ts`
(the runner imports `ScheduledTask` from there). `src/lifeops/wave1-types.ts`
is a slightly diverged copy consumed only by the `first-run` module.

### No-reply semantics

Completion timeouts are structural scheduler behavior, not prompt text. For
scheduled items that wait on a user reply, personal-assistant resolves a
persisted no-reply contract from `metadata.noReplyPolicy` plus
`metadata.noReplyState` and applies it in the single scheduler timeout pass:

```ts
metadata: {
  noReplyPolicy?: {
    maxRetries: number;
    retryCadenceMinutes: number[];
    terminalStatus: "skipped" | "expired" | "failed";
    terminalReason: string;
    sensitive: boolean;
    allowCrossChannel: boolean;
    allowNonOwnerNotification: boolean;
  };
  noReplyState?: {
    retryCount: number;
    lastTimedOutAt?: string;
    nextRetryAt?: string;
    terminalReason?: string;
    terminalOutcome?: "skipped" | "expired" | "failed" | "denied";
  };
}
```

Defaults are deliberately conservative:

- reminders retry once after 60 minutes, then `skipped`;
- check-ins retry once after 24 hours, then `expired`;
- non-sensitive approvals retry after 30 minutes and 2 hours, then `expired`;
- sensitive approvals retry once after 30 minutes, then expire with
  `terminalOutcome: "denied"`;
- cross-channel escalation and non-owner notification default to `false`.

No no-reply path may auto-execute a sensitive output. Silence on money, data,
or external-send approvals fails closed. No-reply expiry is not a user skip, so
approval expiry does not fire `pipeline.onSkip`; authored skip pipelines remain
reserved for explicit skip transitions.

## Default packs

Default packs are bundles of typed scheduled-item definitions compiled into
`ScheduledTask` records (and sometimes anchor-consolidation policies,
escalation ladders, autofill whitelists). LifeOps-owned packs live in
`src/default-packs/`:

- `daily-rhythm` — gm, gn, daily check-in.
- `morning-brief` — fired on `wake.confirmed`.
- `quiet-user-watcher` — daily watcher.
- `habit-starters` — eight habits, **offered** (not auto-seeded).
- `executive-assistant` — twenty-five scheduled records covering twenty
  personal/executive assistant scenario families, **offered** (not auto-seeded).
- `inbox-triage-starter` — opt-in, gated on Gmail.
- `followup-starter` — watcher firing per overdue relationship.
- `autofill-whitelist-pack`, `consolidation-policies`, `escalation-ladders`
  — policy-only packs.

`@elizaos/plugin-health` ships `bedtime`, `wake-up`, `sleep-recap` and
registers them when a health connector pairs.

### Adding a new default pack

1. Add a file under `src/default-packs/<name>.ts` that exports a
   `DefaultPack` matching `registry-types.ts`.
2. Define `ReminderTaskDefinition`, `CheckInTaskDefinition`,
   `WatcherTaskDefinition`, `ApprovalTaskDefinition`, `RecapTaskDefinition`,
   or `OutputTaskDefinition` values and compile them with
   `compileTaskDefinition` / `compileTaskDefinitions`. Pack files should not
   construct raw `ScheduledTaskSeed` records.
3. Import and append it to `DEFAULT_PACKS` in `src/default-packs/index.ts`.
4. If the pack should be **auto-enabled**, list it in
   `getDefaultEnabledPacks`. If it should be **offered** during first-run
   customize, list it in `getOfferedDefaultPacks`. If neither, the pack
   only seeds when invoked explicitly.
5. Run `bun run lint:default-packs` (also runs as `pretest`). The lint
   rules are embedded in `scripts/lint-default-packs.mjs`. CI rejects packs
   that violate them, including raw `ScheduledTask` construction.
6. Add a record-id constant export so consumers can target the records by
   stable ID.

The runtime never seeds packs by name string-match; everything goes through
`getAllDefaultPacks()`.

## Optional household-source credentials

- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` enables Google Routes v2 travel matrices. The key is
  sent in the required request header, never in a URL or persisted result.
- `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` enables Ticketmaster local-activity discovery.
- `INSTACART_API_KEY` enables an approved Instacart products-link handoff.
- `INSTACART_ENVIRONMENT=development|production` selects the documented
  Instacart endpoint and defaults to `production`.

Weather uses the public US National Weather Service API and therefore has
explicit US-only coverage. Missing credentials or source outages produce
`unavailable` observations rather than healthy empty results. An Instacart
products link is only a review handoff: it is not evidence of cart contents,
checkout, an order, payment, delivery, or a substitution decision.

## Knowledge graph

`EntityStore` (nodes) and `RelationshipStore` (edges) at
`src/lifeops/entities/` and `src/lifeops/relationships/`. The graph is
per-agent. The `entityId === "self"` row is bootstrapped on first use.

- **Cadence lives on the edge.** "Pat — every 14 days" is a
  `Relationship`, not an `Entity` attribute. Cadence-bearing
  `ScheduledTask`s use `subject.kind = "relationship"`.
- **Identities are observed.** `(platform, handle)` pairs route through
  `observeIdentity`; the merge engine in `entities/merge.ts` collapses
  entities with high-confidence identity matches. Manual merges go through
  `POST /api/lifeops/entities/merge` and are audited.
- **REST surface** — routes live in `src/routes/`.

## Pause and handoff

- **Global pause** (`global-pause/store.ts`) — stops every
  `ScheduledTask` with `respectsGlobalPause: true`. Toggleable via UI or
  `/api/lifeops/app-state`.
- **Per-room handoff** (`handoff/store.ts`) — flips a multi-party room
  into handoff after the agent says "I'll let you take it from here."
  Typed resume conditions (`mention | explicit_resume | silence_minutes |
  user_request_help`). The `RoomPolicyProvider` reads
  `HandoffStore.status(roomId).active` and gates further agent
  contributions.

## Brief engagement feedback

`BRIEF` persists impressions only for structured item titles that actually
appear in a successfully delivered narrative; a JSON action result or a failed
callback is not treated as owner visibility. Rows retain the producing
trajectory identity. Authoritative same-day domain mutations can attribute
`opened`, `replied`, `completed`, `rescheduled`, or `kept` outcomes through
`LifeOpsRepository.attributeBriefItemEngagement`; occurrence completion is the
first production bridge. Shipped authoritative bridges also cover occurrence
snooze and calendar time updates (`rescheduled`), Gmail mark-read (`opened`),
and provider-confirmed Gmail replies (`replied`). A real `kept` meeting remains
reserved for a future explicit attendance/outcome contract; elapsed wall-clock
time alone is not fabricated as engagement. Attribution uses the rolling 24-hour delivery window,
so an owner-local day crossing UTC midnight remains linked without making UTC
midnight a behavioral boundary. Expired unacted delivery windows finalize
idempotently as `ignored` when the brief path next runs.

Provider retries carrying the same domain event ID collapse to one row. Two
distinct provider event IDs remain distinct even when item, engagement type,
and timestamp are identical, so neither authoritative mutation is overwritten.

Editorial recalibration reads a rolling 30-day window. Explicit `demoted` and
`restored` markers control ranking without conflating a restore command with a
real kept meeting. Non-zero engagement rewards settle onto the original
morning-brief trajectory through the trajectory service's idempotent delayed
reward API, without reopening or rewriting a completed step.
Settlement uses a durable lease marker plus the trajectory's idempotent reward
receipt: an abandoned claim can be taken after its lease, and a crash after the
trajectory update is recovered by observing the already-applied receipt.
Recovery scans a bounded pending-outcome batch independently of the editorial
30-day window, so a long outage cannot strand an old reward. Completed receipts,
zero-weight outcomes, trajectory-less legacy rows, and outcomes with active
leases are excluded from that batch; an expired lease re-enters in chronological
order. A failed or missing trajectory retains a released marker and rotates by
last-attempt time, so one poisoned oldest row cannot starve newer pending
rewards. Operational markers are also excluded from editorial history reads.

## Plugin dependencies

LifeOps consumes `@elizaos/plugin-health` for sleep/circadian/health metrics,
screen-time action planning, health action planning, health-context formatting,
and health connector contributions.
The plugin contributes through the registries listed above (`AnchorRegistry`,
`ConnectorRegistry`, `FamilyRegistry`, default packs) and public factories such
as `createHealthActionRunner`, `createScreenTimeActionRunner`, and
`createHealthProvider`. LifeOps does not import directly into the health
internals; it consumes the plugin's public exports only. See
`plugins/plugin-health/README.md`.

## Cross-agent invariants

1. The runner never pattern-matches `promptInstructions`.
2. `subject.kind = "relationship"` for cadence-bearing tasks.
3. Identities are observed, not assigned.
4. Connectors and channels return typed `DispatchResult`. No `boolean`.
5. `shouldFire.gates` is always an array.
6. `acknowledged` ≠ `completed`. Pipeline `onComplete` only fires on
   `completed`.
7. Snooze resets the escalation ladder.
8. Global pause skips tasks with `respectsGlobalPause: true`.
