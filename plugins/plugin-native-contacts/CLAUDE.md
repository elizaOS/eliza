# @elizaos/capacitor-contacts

Capacitor plugin that exposes Android's `ContactsContract` to an Eliza agent's JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, with an explicit web fallback.

## Purpose / role

This is a [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) plugin (not an elizaOS `Plugin` object). It does not register elizaOS actions, providers, or evaluators directly. Instead it exposes a typed JS bridge (`Contacts`) that elizaOS actions in other packages can call to read, create, and import contacts on Android. On web/node the bridge returns empty results or throws for write operations.

The plugin is opt-in: it must be registered with Capacitor in the host Android app and imported explicitly by any elizaOS action that needs it.

## Plugin surface

This is a Capacitor bridge plugin, not an elizaOS plugin. It exposes one global object:

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Contacts` | Registered Capacitor plugin instance (`ElizaContacts` bridge) |
| `ContactsPlugin` | TypeScript interface for the three bridge methods |
| `ContactSummary` | Type for a returned contact record |
| `ListContactsOptions` | Options for `listContacts` |
| `CreateContactOptions` | Options for `createContact` |
| `ImportVCardOptions` | Options for `importVCard` |
| `ImportedContactSummary` | Extended `ContactSummary` with `sourceName` |

### Bridge methods

| Method | Platform | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `listContacts(options?)` | Android | Requires `READ_CONTACTS`. Optional `query` (case-insensitive search across name/phone/email) and `limit` (1–500, default 100). Returns `{ contacts: ContactSummary[] }`. |
| `createContact(options)` | Android | Requires `WRITE_CONTACTS`. `displayName` required; accepts `phoneNumber`/`phoneNumbers` and `emailAddress`/`emailAddresses`. Returns `{ id: string }`. |
| `importVCard(options)` | Android | Requires `WRITE_CONTACTS`. Parses RFC 6350 vCard text (handles line folding, `FN`/`N`/`TEL`/`EMAIL` fields, `\`-escapes). Returns `{ imported: ImportedContactSummary[] }`. |

Web fallback (`ContactsWeb`): `listContacts` returns `{ contacts: [] }`, `createContact`/`importVCard` throw.

## Layout

```
plugins/plugin-native-contacts/
  src/
    index.ts          — registerPlugin("ElizaContacts") + re-exports everything from definitions
    definitions.ts    — all TypeScript interfaces (ContactSummary, ContactsPlugin, …)
    web.ts            — ContactsWeb (web fallback: listContacts=[], writes throw)
  android/
    src/main/
      AndroidManifest.xml                         — READ_CONTACTS + WRITE_CONTACTS permissions
      java/ai/eliza/plugins/contacts/
        ContactsPlugin.kt                         — full Kotlin implementation: listContacts, createContact, importVCard, vCard parser
    build.gradle
  rollup.config.mjs   — bundles dist/esm → dist/plugin.js (IIFE) + dist/plugin.cjs.js
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
```

## Commands

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-contacts build    # clean + tsc + rollup
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-contacts clean    # rm dist/
```

`prepublishOnly` runs `build` automatically on `bun publish`.

## Config / env vars

None. This plugin requires no env vars. Android runtime permissions (`READ_CONTACTS`, `WRITE_CONTACTS`) are declared in the plugin's `AndroidManifest.xml` and merged by the host app's build system. The host app must grant them at runtime before calling bridge methods.

## How to extend

### Add a new bridge method

1. Add the method signature to `src/definitions.ts` in `ContactsPlugin`.
2. Implement the web fallback in `src/web.ts` (`ContactsWeb`).
3. Implement the real method in `android/src/main/java/ai/eliza/plugins/contacts/ContactsPlugin.kt` — annotate with `@PluginMethod`, check permissions with `hasPermission(Manifest.permission.*)`, resolve or reject the `PluginCall`.
4. Run `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-contacts build` to regenerate `dist/`.
5. Rebuild the host Android app so the new method is available in the webview bridge.

### Add a new type

Add the interface/type to `src/definitions.ts` and re-export via `src/index.ts` (already covered by `export * from "./definitions"`).

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Capacitor, not elizaOS Plugin.** Import `Contacts` from this package and call its methods; do not try to load it via `elizaOS`'s plugin loader.
- **Android only for writes.** `createContact` and `importVCard` are hard-fails on web. Design any elizaOS action that calls them to check the platform first.
- **Permissions are feature-gated, not app-required.** The plugin declares the `contacts` alias (`READ_CONTACTS`/`WRITE_CONTACTS`) in `@CapacitorPlugin(permissions=…)`, so the Capacitor base `Plugin` auto-provides `checkPermissions()` / `requestPermissions()` (`{ contacts: PermissionState }`; web returns `granted`). The Contacts view calls `requestPermissions()` on first open (idempotent — already-granted never re-prompts) and shows a grant-in-settings message if denied. Nothing requests contacts at app launch. The bridge methods still reject if not granted (defensive); do NOT add a launch-time or app-wide contacts gate.
- **limit guard.** `listContacts` enforces `1 ≤ limit ≤ 500`; requests outside that range are rejected.
- **vCard parser is internal.** `parseVCards` in `ContactsPlugin.kt` handles RFC 6350 line folding and the `FN`/`N`/`TEL`/`EMAIL` properties. It intentionally ignores other vCard fields. Photo data is not imported.
- **Build output.** The published package ships `dist/esm/` (ESM, consumed by bundlers) and `dist/plugin.cjs.js` (CJS). The `bun`/`development` export condition points directly to `src/index.ts` for zero-build dev.
- **Peer dep.** `@capacitor/core ^8.3.1` must be present in the consuming app.

## ⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE — evidence, trajectories & real end-to-end tests

> The binding, repo-wide standard is **[PR_EVIDENCE.md](../../PR_EVIDENCE.md)**. Read it.
> Nothing in this package is *done* until it is *proven* done — a reviewer must confirm it
> works **without reading the code**, from the artifacts you attach. This applies to **every**
> feature, fix, refactor, and chore here. "Tests pass" is not proof; "CI is green" is not proof.

- **Record AND read model trajectories.** Capture the *actual* inputs and outputs of the model
  from a **live** LLM — not the deterministic proxy, not a mock: the prompt, the
  providers/context, the raw model output, every tool/action call, and the result. Then **open
  the trajectory and review it by hand.** A captured-but-unread trajectory is not evidence
  (`packages/scenario-runner/bin/eliza-scenarios run <scenario> --report <out>`).
- **Real, full-featured E2E — no larp.** Every feature ships detailed end-to-end tests that
  drive the *real* path end to end. Not the happy "front door" only: cover error paths,
  edge/empty/invalid input, concurrency, roles/permissions, and adversarial input. A test that
  asserts against a mock/stub/fixture standing in for the thing under test **does not count**.
  If the real model/device/chain/connector/account is hard to reach, **make it reachable — that
  is the work**, not an excuse to mock. If the existing tests here are shallow or mocked, fixing
  them is part of your change.
- **Screenshots + logs at every phase**, plus a **complete walkthrough video/run-through** of
  the entire feature or view, start to finish (`bun run test:e2e:record`).
- **Manually review every artifact the change touches** — never just the green check: client
  logs (console + network), server logs (`[ClassName] …`), the model trajectories in and out,
  before/after full-page screenshots, **and the domain artifacts listed below for this package.**
- **No residuals. No shortcuts.** The goal is not "done" — it is *everything* done. Clear every
  blocker by the **hard path**: build the real architecture, stand up the real
  model/device/service, actually test it. Never leave a TODO, a stub, a stepping-stone, or a
  "follow-up." When unsure, research thoroughly, weigh the options, and ship the best,
  highest-effort, production-ready version. Keep going until every possibility is exhausted.

Artifacts → `.github/issue-evidence/<issue#>-<slug>.<ext>`; attach each evidence type **or**
explicitly mark it N/A with a reason — never leave it blank. If `develop` moved and changed
behavior, **re-capture** evidence; stale proof is worse than none.

**Capture & manually review for this package — native / on-device bridge:**
- The capability run on a **real device or simulator** — not desktop Chromium against a mocked bridge (see #9967/#9580): device logs + the captured output (photo, OCR text, detection boxes, transcript, sensor reading).
- Parity vs the reference implementation where one exists (e.g. the Python/Ultralytics reference), with the numeric tolerances actually met.
- Permission-denied, no-hardware, and background/foreground lifecycle paths.
- A short recording of the on-device run; confirm the build under test is yours (versionName / a known on-screen change), not a stale install.
