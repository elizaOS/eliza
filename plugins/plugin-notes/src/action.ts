/**
 * NOTES — the chat door onto the durable notes store.
 *
 * The notes view already exposes create/read/update/delete as view
 * capabilities, but those resolve only through PAGE_DELEGATE against an OPEN
 * view, so an agent without a UI client (a Discord/chat-only deployment) had
 * no way to reach notes at all. "make a note" then fell through to whatever
 * else matched — DATABASE hand-writing SQL, or the room-gated owner todo
 * surface — and the note was silently lost.
 *
 * This action wraps the SAME `NotesService` the view uses, so a note written
 * in chat and a note written in the app are one record in one store. It adds
 * no storage, no second source of truth, and no new persistence path.

The first line is the note's label and later lines are its body.

    "writing something down for later with no time attached ('make a note', 'note to self', 'write down that …', 'jot this down', 'remember that …') -> NOTES_CREATE with content. ANY read over the user's notes -> NOTES_LIST. For an exact note ID use NOTES_GET with noteId and omit content; content searches titles/bodies, not IDs. For a specific topic ('search my notes for X', 'find my note about X', 'do i have a note on X', 'what did my note say about X'), pass content=X so unrelated personal notes are not exposed; omit content when the owner asks for all notes, counts, or a recency comparison without a topic. Recency is determined from returned createdAt/updatedAt fields, never by searching for words such as 'latest' or 'most recently updated'. A notes search is NEVER a document search: never route it to SEARCH_DOCUMENTS, DOCUMENT, FILES or DATABASE, which do not index notes and will answer 'nothing found' for a note that exists. REMOVING one ('delete the note about X', 'forget the note about X', 'remove my note on X') -> NOTES_DELETE with content=the identifying text. CHANGING one -> NOTES_UPDATE with content identifying the existing note. For a literal substitution use textEdit with field, oldText and newText; no full-note read or rewrite is needed. For a general rewrite use replacementContent with the complete updated note, preserving the existing first-line label and all unedited lines. Deleting and updating are NOT reads: never answer a removal or change request with NOTES_LIST. RECALLING A FACT the user once asked you to note ('who is alex again', 'what did i say about X') is answered from the SAVED_NOTES context block, which is the same store; when that block reports notes it did not show, call NOTES_LIST before answering. A memory search that returns nothing is not evidence a note does not exist — MEMORY does not index notes. A note is NOT a todo and NOT a calendar event: anything with a date or time block -> CALENDAR, anything that should ping the user at a time -> TRIGGER.
