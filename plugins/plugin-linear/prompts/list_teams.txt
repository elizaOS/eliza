Extract team filter criteria from the user's request.

User request: "{{userMessage}}"

The user might ask for teams in various ways:
- "Show me all teams" → list all teams
- "Engineering teams" → filter by teams with engineering in name/description
- "List teams I'm part of" → filter by membership
- "Which teams work on the mobile app?" → filter by description/focus
- "Show me the ELIZA team details" → specific team lookup
- "Active teams" → teams with recent activity
- "Frontend and backend teams" → multiple team types

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "nameFilter": "Keywords to search in team names",
  "specificTeam": "Specific team name or key if looking for one team",
  "myTeams": true/false (true if user wants their teams),
  "showAll": true/false (true if user explicitly asks for "all"),
  "includeDetails": true/false (true if user wants detailed info)
}

Only include fields that are clearly mentioned.
