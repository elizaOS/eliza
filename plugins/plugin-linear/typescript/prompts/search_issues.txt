Extract search criteria from the user's request for Linear issues.

User request: "{{userMessage}}"

The user might express searches in various ways:
- "Show me what John is working on" → assignee filter
- "Any blockers for the next release?" → priority/label filters
- "Issues created this week" → date range filter
- "My high priority bugs" → assignee (current user) + priority + label
- "Unassigned tasks in the backend team" → no assignee + team filter
- "What did Sarah close yesterday?" → assignee + state + date
- "Bugs that are almost done" → label + state filter
- "Show me the oldest open issues" → state + sort order

Extract and return ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "query": "General search text for title/description",
  "states": ["state names like In Progress, Done, Todo, Backlog"],
  "assignees": ["assignee names or emails, or 'me' for current user"],
  "priorities": ["urgent/high/normal/low or 1/2/3/4"],
  "teams": ["team names or keys"],
  "labels": ["label names"],
  "hasAssignee": true/false (true = has assignee, false = unassigned),
  "dateRange": {
    "field": "created/updated/completed",
    "period": "today/yesterday/this-week/last-week/this-month/last-month",
    "from": "ISO date if specific date",
    "to": "ISO date if specific date"
  },
  "sort": {
    "field": "created/updated/priority",
    "order": "asc/desc"
  },
  "limit": number (default 10)
}

Only include fields that are clearly mentioned or implied. For "my" issues, set assignees to ["me"].
