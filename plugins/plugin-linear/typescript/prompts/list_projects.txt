Extract project filter criteria from the user's request.

User request: "{{userMessage}}"

The user might ask for projects in various ways:
- "Show me all projects" → list all projects
- "Active projects" → filter by state (active/planned/completed)
- "Projects due this quarter" → filter by target date
- "Which projects is Sarah managing?" → filter by lead/owner
- "Projects with high priority issues" → filter by contained issue priority
- "Projects for the engineering team" → filter by team
- "Completed projects" → filter by state
- "Projects starting next month" → filter by start date

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "teamFilter": "Team name or key if mentioned",
  "stateFilter": "active/planned/completed/all",
  "dateFilter": {
    "type": "due/starting",
    "period": "this-week/this-month/this-quarter/next-month/next-quarter",
    "from": "ISO date if specific",
    "to": "ISO date if specific"
  },
  "leadFilter": "Project lead name if mentioned",
  "showAll": true/false (true if user explicitly asks for "all")
}

Only include fields that are clearly mentioned.
