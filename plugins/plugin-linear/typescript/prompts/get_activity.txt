Extract activity filter criteria from the user's request.

User request: "{{userMessage}}"

The user might ask for activity in various ways:
- "Show me today's activity" → time range filter
- "What issues were created?" → action type filter
- "What did John do yesterday?" → user filter + time range
- "Activity on ENG-123" → resource filter
- "Recent comment activity" → action type + recency
- "Failed operations this week" → success filter + time range

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "timeRange": {
    "period": "today/yesterday/this-week/last-week/this-month",
    "from": "ISO datetime if specific",
    "to": "ISO datetime if specific"
  },
  "actionTypes": ["create_issue/update_issue/delete_issue/create_comment/search_issues/etc"],
  "resourceTypes": ["issue/project/comment/team"],
  "resourceId": "Specific resource ID if mentioned (e.g., ENG-123)",
  "user": "User name or 'me' for current user",
  "successFilter": "success/failed/all",
  "limit": number (default 10)
}

Only include fields that are clearly mentioned.
