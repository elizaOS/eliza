{
  "issueId": "The issue identifier (e.g., ENG-123, COM2-7)",
  "updates": {
    "title": "New title if changing the title",
    "description": "New description if changing the description",
    "priority": "Priority level if changing (1=urgent, 2=high, 3=normal, 4=low)",
    "teamKey": "New team key if moving to another team (e.g., ENG, ELIZA, COM2)",
    "assignee": "New assignee username or email if changing",
    "status": "New status if changing (e.g., todo, in-progress, done, canceled)",
    "labels": ["label1", "label2"] (if changing labels, empty array to clear)
  }
}

Only include fields that are being updated. Return only the JSON object, no other text.
