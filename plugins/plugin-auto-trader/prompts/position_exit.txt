Evaluate the position and provide an exit decision:

```json
{
  "decision": "HOLD" | "PARTIAL_EXIT" | "FULL_EXIT",
  "exitPercentage": "percentage of position to exit (0-100)",
  "urgency": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH" | "IMMEDIATE",
  "reasoning": "detailed explanation",
  "marketAnalysis": {
    "trendDirection": "BULLISH" | "BEARISH" | "NEUTRAL",
    "momentumStrength": "STRONG" | "MODERATE" | "WEAK",
    "volumeSignal": "ACCUMULATION" | "DISTRIBUTION" | "NEUTRAL"
  },
  "riskUpdate": {
    "currentRiskLevel": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH" | "CRITICAL",
    "newConcerns": ["any new risk factors"],
    "originalThesisIntact": true | false
  },
  "revisedTargets": {
    "newStopLoss": "updated stop loss if any",
    "newTakeProfit": "updated take profit if any",
    "trailingStopSuggestion": "if applicable"
  }
}
```

Exit triggers to consider:
1. Price hit stop loss or take profit
2. Original thesis invalidated
3. Significant negative news or events
4. Better opportunity cost elsewhere
5. Risk/reward ratio deteriorated
6. Liquidity concerns emerged
7. Time-based exit (position held too long)

Be decisive - don't recommend holding losing positions hoping for recovery unless thesis is truly intact.

Respond ONLY with the JSON object.
