# Preview the component catalog

The catalog is generated from the project's React components and their
metadata. This model selects a component and one of its stories. Search
text and temporary prop overrides stay in the page; choosing another
component or story clears those overrides. Refreshing an unchanged catalog
keeps the selected preview and its overrides.

### A catalog records how many stories each component has

The catalog supplies components, props, stories and document links. Their
order gives each component and story its position; a position of minus one
means there is no selection.

```quint
type Selection = { key: str, counts: List[int], component: int, story: int }
pure def hasComponent(p: Selection, at: int): bool = 0 <= at and at < p.counts.length()
pure def hasStory(p: Selection, at: int): bool =
  hasComponent(p, p.component) and 0 <= at and at < p.counts.nthOr(p.component, 0)
```

### Before a catalog is loaded nothing is selected

```quint
pure val initial: Selection = { key: "", counts: List(), component: -1, story: -1 }
```

### Loading a catalog selects its first component and that component's first story

An empty catalog has no selection. A component without stories has no
selected story. Every story count is nonnegative. The key identifies the
ordered component and story identities: an unchanged key is refused, so a
refresh leaves the selected preview and its prop overrides in place.

```quint
pure def canLoad(p: Selection, counts: List[int], key: str): bool =
  key != p.key and counts.every(n => n >= 0)
pure def load(p: Selection, counts: List[int], key: str): Selection =
  { key: key, counts: counts, component: if (counts.length() > 0) 0 else -1,
    story: if (counts.nthOr(0, 0) > 0) 0 else -1 }
```

### Choosing a component selects its first story and clears prop overrides

Only a component in the catalog can be chosen. Prop overrides are draft
controls in the page and are cleared alongside this selection.

```quint
pure def canChooseComponent(p: Selection, at: int): bool = hasComponent(p, at)
pure def chooseComponent(p: Selection, at: int): Selection =
  { ...p, component: at, story: if (p.counts.nthOr(at, 0) > 0) 0 else -1 }
```

### Choosing a story stays within its component and clears prop overrides

The prop controls show the chosen story's arguments or the component's
defaults until a person overrides them. Model links select the spec;
source and design links open their files in the editor.

```quint
pure def canChooseStory(p: Selection, at: int): bool = hasStory(p, at)
pure def chooseStory(p: Selection, at: int): Selection = { ...p, story: at }
```

### Every selected component and story exists in the loaded catalog

```quint
pure def alwaysSelectionExists(p: Selection): bool =
  p.counts.every(n => n >= 0) and
  (if (p.counts.length() == 0) p.component == -1 and p.story == -1
   else hasComponent(p, p.component) and
     (if (p.counts.nthOr(p.component, 0) == 0) p.story == -1 else hasStory(p, p.story)))
```

### A component without stories and a later story can both be inspected

```quint
pure def sometimesNoStory(p: Selection): bool = hasComponent(p, p.component) and p.story == -1
pure def sometimesLaterStory(p: Selection): bool = p.component > 0 and p.story > 0
```
