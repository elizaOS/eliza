It’s a pleasure to be here today at the American Enterprise Institute to speak about the opportunity in front of us to rethink technology’s relationship to the family.

Today, I want to discuss a deeper, philosophical alliance between technology and the institution of the family.\n\nWe recently watched the Vice President head to France where he discussed the importance of American dominance in artificial intelligence, and I’ve been struck by the new administration’s focus on innovation. Those of us listening to the inaugural address just last month couldn’t help but notice references to colonizing Mars, the split atom, holding all the world’s knowledge in the palm of our hands. It’s refreshing to see technology celebrated as the engine of American economic growth after years of Washington denigrating it. And we’re now finally seeing enthusiasm for how government can leverage our technology sector to promote American Dynamism by unleashing limitless energy, deterring conflict, and manufacturing abundance of all kinds.\n\nAnd indeed, investing in American Dynamism my day job, my life’s work and my calling. But today, I want to talk about my other job. My most consequential job according to the Ordo Amoris, a job that is deeply tied to building American Dynamism in the most concrete way. And that is my job and my duty as Mother. For all the talk of Technology and the State, there should be much more talk about that other institution that is perpetually at war with it.\n\nThe Institution of the Family.\n\nAll of history is a war between the family and the state. Any college student studying Plato’s Republic learns quickly of this conflict, though it’s often only discussed in political theory classes. But in practice, it’s clear these two institutions are often incompatible in their quest for control over how we live, what we believe, what we worship, our history and our daily reality. If this sounds a bit hyperbolic because the family now seeminglysits comfortably inside the state, that is because the state has been winning this civilizational war against the family for decades.\n\nThe long 20th Century should teach us this. It is a story of American growth and excellence, but it can also be accurately told as a story of the weakening of the family. It begins with thefundamental transformation of industry, where mothers and fathers are pulled from the home to work in factories, then companies.

The strength of states is greatly intertwined with war—states grow stronger in war while families are literally destroyed. It’s no coincidence that as we look to our European neighbors, we now see a continent subsumed with regulation, censorship, green authoritarianism, and a birth rate that predicts their demise.\n\nA very strong state, yes.

It was a reminder that the family is not, nor will ever be powerful enough to compete with the Chinese Communist Party.",

      "text": "Great news!\n\nAfter years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week) this would be a full dismissal, with $0 in fines paid and zero changes to our business.\n\nThis is hugely vindicating, especially because many people questioned my decision to engage in litigation with the SEC on this matter in 2023. People told me the courts would give a lot of leeway to the government. They said public market investors wouldn't like it. They said it would take years and cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal fees (which it did). They said the agency would use mafia tactics like trying to pressure other companies not to work with us while the lawsuit was underway (which they did).\n\nBut I knew a few truths that helped make it an easy decision to fight them in court:\n\n1. The SEC was wrong on the law.\nThey were exceeding the authority given to them by congress by asking us to delist a number of assets that were not securities. We had taken a conservative approach to ensure we weren't listing any securities, and the SEC itself had allowed us to go public in 2021 after reviewing our listing standards in depth. We tried to “come in and register” but it turned out it was a fake offer, as every crypto company discovered.

      "html": "Great news!<br><br>After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week) this would be a full dismissal, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%240\">$0</a> in fines paid and zero changes to our business.<br><br>This is hugely vindicating, especially because many people questioned my decision to engage in litigation with the SEC on this matter in 2023. People told me the courts would give a lot of leeway to the government. They said public market investors wouldn't like it. They said it would take years and cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal fees (which it did). They said the agency would use mafia tactics like trying to pressure other companies not to work with us while the lawsuit was underway (which they did).<br><br>But I knew a few truths that helped make it an easy decision to fight them in court:<br><br>1. The SEC was wrong on the law.<br>They were exceeding the authority given to them by congress by asking us to delist a number of assets that were not securities. We had taken a conservative approach to ensure we weren't listing any securities, and the SEC itself had allowed us to go public in 2021 after reviewing our listing standards in depth. We tried to “come in and register” but it turned out it was a fake offer, as every crypto company discovered. Regulators are supposed to enforce the law, but they can't make up new laws on the spot if they don't like the current ones, or weaponize a lack of clarity in the law.<br><br>2.

      "text": "Let’s examine this step by step:\nhttps://t.co/n4ipDE06tq Framework Overview\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against individuals based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. This protection applies regardless of an applicant’s or employee’s citizenship status, provided the individual is lawfully present and has authorization to work in the United States.\n2.Application to Chinese Citizens on Visas\nChinese citizens in the U.S. on a visa—whether it’s an H-1B, L-1, or any other work-authorized visa—are legally present and, importantly, have work authorization. Title VII’s protections extend to these individuals. This means that if an employer refuses to hire a Chinese citizen solely because of their national origin, that employer would be in violation of federal law.\nhttps://t.co/dUbwWjtG2K Precedent and Enforcement\nCourts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have consistently held that discrimination based on national origin applies to all legally authorized workers. The law does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens when it comes to protection from discrimination in employment, as long as the noncitizen is legally permitted to work.\n4.Clarification on Work Authorization\nThe key factor is that the individual must have legal work authorization. If a Chinese citizen is in the U.S. on a visa that does not allow employment (for example, a tourist visa), then the legal context changes because the individual isn’t eligible for employment to begin with. However, for any Chinese citizen on a visa with work authorization, the protections are fully applicable.\n5.Conclusion\nYes, I am sure that these anti-discrimination protections apply to Chinese citizens who are in the U.S. on a visa with proper work authorization. Employers cannot legally decide not to hire someone solely based on their national origin, regardless of their citizenship status, as long as the person is legally authorized to work.\n\nThis legal framework is firmly established, and employers who violate it can face significant legal repercussions through enforcement by the EEOC or through private litigation.",

    "text": "Let’s examine this step by step:\nhttps://t.co/n4ipDE06tq Framework Overview\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is unlawful for employers to discriminate against individuals based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. This protection applies regardless of an applicant’s or employee’s citizenship status, provided the individual is lawfully present and has authorization to work in the United States.\n2.Application to Chinese Citizens on Visas\nChinese citizens in the U.S. on a visa—whether it’s an H-1B, L-1, or any other work-authorized visa—are legally present and, importantly, have work authorization. Title VII’s protections extend to these individuals. This means that if an employer refuses to hire a Chinese citizen solely because of their national origin, that employer would be in violation of federal law.\nhttps://t.co/dUbwWjtG2K Precedent and Enforcement\nCourts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have consistently held that discrimination based on national origin applies to all legally authorized workers. The law does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens when it comes to protection from discrimination in employment, as long as the noncitizen is legally permitted to work.\n4.Clarification on Work Authorization\nThe key factor is that the individual must have legal work authorization. If a Chinese citizen is in the U.S. on a visa that does not allow employment (for example, a tourist visa), then the legal context changes because the individual isn’t eligible for employment to begin with. However, for any Chinese citizen on a visa with work authorization, the protections are fully applicable.\n5.Conclusion\nYes, I am sure that these anti-discrimination protections apply to Chinese citizens who are in the U.S. on a visa with proper work authorization. Employers cannot legally decide not to hire someone solely based on their national origin, regardless of their citizenship status, as long as the person is legally authorized to work.\n\nThis legal framework is firmly established, and employers who violate it can face significant legal repercussions through enforcement by the EEOC or through private litigation.",

Millions on healthcare facilities that don't exist. $70 million on contractor fees for projects that were canceled before being started, but they got to keep the money anyway. That sounds nice.\n\nA contractor built a $500k police training facility that melted when it rained because it was made from sand.

      "text": "More than two thirds of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware is home to more than 1.8 million corporations, more than the number of residents in the state. In 2023, 80% of all US IPOs were registered in Delaware. More than half of Delaware’s total public revenue comes from this—primarily through levying franchise taxes and seizing unclaimed property (eg all unused gift cards or uncashed checks with unknown owners held by companies headquartered in the state).\n\nBefore the 1830s, people often had to receive individualized permission from their legislature to incorporate businesses. Before the 1880s, business corporations were primarily regulated by their charters of incorporation (eg state laws required their private constitutions to include limits on size, purpose, duration, profits, etc). But then our legal system switched into regulating corporate activities rather than corporate charters: each state could pass laws limiting corporate behavior within their borders, regardless of where they were chartered, but they could no longer discriminate against out-of-state charters.\n\nAnd so every major business began incorporating in the state of… New Jersey! Because it pioneered and led the race to discover desirable incorporation criteria. And then Wilson became governor for two years (1911-1913), and reversed all of these laws aggressively enough to chase all the major corporations to Delaware, where they’ve remained ever since. (Oddly though this is now in many respects the last grand vestige of state sovereignty in corporate regulation, as limits on corporate behavior were seized by the national congress in the 1930s and by the national agencies in the 1970s).\n\nThis was also the general period in which pretty much every state merged its “courts of equity” into its “common law courts.” The Anglo legal system had long maintained separate “chancery courts” (which focus more on “fairness” and “management” than strict law, and have way more judicial discretion), but these fell from favor as the common law courts codified their own rules—eg as in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure—which modernized and standardized and formalized and streamlined the common law system into something much more workable.\n\nAnd but so Delaware kept its Court of Chancery separate, and gave its judges expansive unilateral powers in corporate affairs to creatively issue injunctions and restraining orders, and to demand specific performance and restitution. The few other states that maintain separate courts of equity basically restrict them to matters like family court. But in Delaware, the governor’s most important power by far is appointing these seven judges to decide—without constraints like juries or law—how “poison pills” work, and which mergers must be blocked, and so much more.\n\nThis is of course quite fragile power: if the judges use this leeway irresponsibly, then the majority of Delaware’s revenue, and its only influence on the world, will vanish. And so there were various checks imposed on them, from the typical—all matters of fact would be determined in courts of law, all decisions would be kept within the bounds of law by appellate courts, etc—to the specific (eg the judges must always be split 4-3 between the two major parties).\n\nAnd now that fragile power is breaking. Their court so clearly abused its power for crazy partisan reasons—especially against Musk—that it can’t be trusted anymore (especially now that we know the president won’t crack down on us for exiting from established prestige monopolies). It was supposed to be mature shadowy power, but so immature performative power captured and puppeted it. Think of it like how the president is supposed to be loud and the agencies are supposed to be quiet, but so during the Delaware presidency this script was flipped: we had an absent vague “president” and screeching politicized “experts.”\n\nAll of this is, in my view, good. I’d like to see more courts operate like the Court of Chancery, precisely because this allows for more competition between them (unless they outlaw competition). The problem in my view isn’t that the administrative agencies have acted with increasing discretion—in fact, that’s their one saving grace—but rather that they’ve insulated themselves from competition, as if they’re still just following the rules that nobody can ever be allowed to defect from.\n\nThe time of Romance—of agency, leadership, discretion, difference, individuality, brilliance, passion, etc—is returning precisely because the Romance of our old elites has been so clearly shriveling. The very failure of this freewheeling-and-yet-elite body is the herald of true freewheeling elitism. We were almost stuck with boring kludgy infrastructure cargo cults (eg worshipping the 11 powerless child-sovereigns of the S&P500) but now there can be sturm und drang again, and the creativity and selection that goes along with that.",

It was supposed to be mature shadowy power, but so immature performative power captured and puppeted it. Think of it like how the president is supposed to be loud and the agencies are supposed to be quiet, but so during the Delaware presidency this script was flipped: we had an absent vague “president” and screeching politicized “experts.”<br><br>All of this is, in my view, good. I’d like to see more courts operate like the Court of Chancery, precisely because this allows for more competition between them (unless they outlaw competition). The problem in my view isn’t that the administrative agencies have acted with increasing discretion—in fact, that’s their one saving grace—but rather that they’ve insulated themselves from competition, as if they’re still just following the rules that nobody can ever be allowed to defect from.<br><br>The time of Romance—of agency, leadership, discretion, difference, individuality, brilliance, passion, etc—is returning precisely because the Romance of our old elites has been so clearly shriveling. The very failure of this freewheeling-and-yet-elite body is the herald of true freewheeling elitism. We were almost stuck with boring kludgy infrastructure cargo cults (eg worshipping the 11 powerless child-sovereigns of the S&P500) but now there can be sturm und drang again, and the creativity and selection that goes along with that.<br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GitwIVYWAAE9mbo.jpg\"/><br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GitwMdeXkAArvT3.jpg\"/><br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GitwNKaXkAAtmNR.jpg\"/><br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GitwOCmX0AA3lcq.jpg\"/>",

      "text": "I just received \"Superagency\" by Reid Hoffman, and from the first pages it is obvious that it's going to be a forgettable book about The Current Thing. No depth whatsoever.  Does anyone remember \"The Road Ahead\" or \"Business @ the speed of thought\" by Bill Gates? Nope. Why? Because Hoffman and Gates are simply intellectual tourists in their respective subjects (AI and The Internets). Which makes me think about two books that have stood the test of time. \"Information Rules\" by Varian and Shapiro, and \"Out of Control\" by Kelly. Why are these books still so good? Because the authors, even if they were (kind of) referring to their present, they were in fact writing about subjects they had thought about their entire life. This is also the reason why \"Zero to one\" by Thiel is still relevant. \n\nWhat's the point here? Don't know...\n1. the world of good books is sparse.\n2. good writers don't improvise. They train for a long time;\n3. read only books that are at least 30 year old?\n\nAs a further thought, or validation: the only lasting book that Michael Lewis has written is \"Liar's Poker\". He'd been an minor insider for three years; it was not The Current Thing; and it's kind of old.\n\nIn the short run, you can safely skip Hoffman's book and the flood of books on AI, including the inevitable future Michael Lewis book on the subject.",

That’s why Harvard and MIT are there.\n\nThese were the two most important American colonies. In a sense they compete and cooperate every 100 years.\n\nIn the mid 1600s they fought back in England itself. First the Cavaliers vamoosed for Virginia, then the Roundheads migrated to Massachusetts.\n\nRoughly speaking: the Cavaliers were the right and the Roundheads were the left, and the English Civil War was over the same themes of hierarchy vs equality.\n\nIn the 1700s they worked together to beat Britain and found the United States.\n\nIn the 1800s their descendants fought in the American Civil War.\n\nIn the 1900s they worked together again to win WW2 and found the American Empire.\n\nNow in the 2000s they are fighting once again, over the same themes of hierarchy (red) vs equality (blue), even if the geographic center of red has been displaced somewhat to the South and the geographic center of blue has been dispersed across the Northeast.\n\nOthers have written about this as well — see the Fourth Turning, Turchin, Yarvin, Walter Russell Mead, Albion’s Seed, and Scott Alexander’s review. See links in next reply.\n\nMy view is that red and blue will unfortunately smash each other to pieces over the next several years, and then gray will have to pick up the pieces.\n\nGray is tech in its modern incarnation of the techbro.\n\nTech is the intellectual successor to Massachusetts, as the migration to the Internet of Harvard’s best proves. Bill Gates, Zuck, and @paulg all moved away from Harvard in the literal sense. And of course Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Vitalik, and many other college dropouts moved away from Harvard in the metonymic sense.\n\nBut in its more recent techbro incarnation, tech is also becoming the virile successor to Virginia. Elon, Zuck, and Palmer Luckey are examples of techbros respectively becoming leaders of men, packing on muscle, and getting serious about the military.\n\nAmazingly, this synthesis — the techbro — did not exist years ago. But it was memed into reality by blue attacks. And has the balance that blue and red both lack. Train weights, yes, but also lift weights.\n\nI think this synthesis, the techbro, will be crucial to what follows. After all, the techbro founded America. Let’s see what they found next.",

First the Cavaliers vamoosed for Virginia, then the Roundheads migrated to Massachusetts.<br><br>Roughly speaking: the Cavaliers were the right and the Roundheads were the left, and the English Civil War was over the same themes of hierarchy vs equality.<br><br>In the 1700s they worked together to beat Britain and found the United States.<br><br>In the 1800s their descendants fought in the American Civil War.<br><br>In the 1900s they worked together again to win WW2 and found the American Empire.<br><br>Now in the 2000s they are fighting once again, over the same themes of hierarchy (red) vs equality (blue), even if the geographic center of red has been displaced somewhat to the South and the geographic center of blue has been dispersed across the Northeast.<br><br>Others have written about this as well — see the Fourth Turning, Turchin, Yarvin, Walter Russell Mead, Albion’s Seed, and Scott Alexander’s review. See links in next reply.<br><br>My view is that red and blue will unfortunately smash each other to pieces over the next several years, and then gray will have to pick up the pieces.<br><br>Gray is tech in its modern incarnation of the techbro.<br><br>Tech is the intellectual successor to Massachusetts, as the migration to the Internet of Harvard’s best proves. Bill Gates, Zuck, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg\">@paulg</a> all moved away from Harvard in the literal sense. And of course Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Vitalik, and many other college dropouts moved away from Harvard in the metonymic sense.<br><br>But in its more recent techbro incarnation, tech is also becoming the virile successor to Virginia. Elon, Zuck, and Palmer Luckey are examples of techbros respectively becoming leaders of men, packing on muscle, and getting serious about the military.<br><br>Amazingly, this synthesis — the techbro — did not exist years ago. But it was memed into reality by blue attacks. And has the balance that blue and red both lack. Train weights, yes, but also lift weights.<br><br>I think this synthesis, the techbro, will be crucial to what follows. After all, the techbro founded America. Let’s see what they found next.",

Puede con su fuerza económica y su soberbia intentar dar un golpe de estado como hicieron con Allende. Pero yo muero en mi ley, resistí la tortura y lo resisto a usted. No quiero esclavistas al lado de Colombia, ya tuvimos muchos y nos liberamos. Lo que quiero al lado de Colombia, son amantes de la libertad. Si usted  no puede acompañarme yo voy a otros lados.

Estrecho  las manos de los blancos libertarios herederos de Lincoln y de los muchachos campesinos negros y blancos de los EEUU,  ante cuyas tumbas llore y recé en un campo de batalla, al que llegue, después de caminar montañas de la toscana italiana y  después de salvarme del covid.\n\nEllos son EEUU y ante ellos me arrodillo, ante más nadie. \n\nTúmbeme presidente y le responderán las Américas y la humanidad.\n\nColombia ahora deja de mirar el norte, mira al mundo, nuestra sangre viene de la  sangre del califato de Córdoba, la civilización en ese entonces, de los latinos romanos del mediterraneo, la civilización de ese entonces, que fundaron la república, la democracia en Atenas; nuestra sangre tiene los resistentes negros convertidos en esclavos por ustedes. En Colombia está el primer territorio libre de América, antes de Washington, de toda la América, allí me cobijo en sus cantos africanos.\n\nMi tierra es de orfebrería existente en época de los faraones egipcios, y de los primeros artistas del mundo en Chiribiquete.\n\nNo nos dominarás nunca. Se opone el guerrero que cabalgaba  nuestras tierras, gritando libertad y que se llama Bolívar\n\nNuestros pueblos son algo temerosos, algo tímidos, son ingenuos y amables, amantes, pero sabrán ganar el canal de Panamá, que ustedes nos quitaron con violencia. Doscientos héroes de toda latinoamerica yacen en Bocas del Toro, actual Panamá, antes Colombia, que ustedes asesinaron.\n\nYo levanto una bandera y como dijera Gaitán, así quede solo, seguirá enarbolada con la dignidad latinoamericana que es la dignidad de América, que su bisabuelo no conoció, y el mio sí,  señor presidente inmigrante en los  EEUU,\n\nSu bloqueo no me asusta; porque Colombia además de ser el país de la belleza, es el corazón del mundo.

      "text": "The libertarian story about cost disease has always been confused and wrong.\n\nThe reason TVs get cheaper while education gets expensive isn't that one is \"technological\" or \"regulated\". There are many regulations on consumer products and imported goods, but fundamentally, consumer goods are a commodity that a competitive marketplace can increase supply of without contesting scarce choke points, like high marginal labor, prime real estate, or prestige signaling slots.\n\nThe picture of our current economy is that TVs are practically free, but you have to pay a high hourly rate to have a human laborer come to your house and install it for you. This is despite there being basically zero regulations or licensing for home TV installation.\n\nObserve that infinite free education through technology has already practically existed for a couple decades and has had basically no effect on the price of formal schooling. If you are frustrated that college education hasn't gotten as cheap as fiber internet this is because you misunderstand what the product being sold is. Online school and community colleges already exist that are affordable and accept anybody; They also won't give you a credential that gets you a competitive job.\n\nAnd who is to blame for devaluing these cheaper education credentials? It's not regulators, but private employers whose hiring decision reinforce the signaling value of expensive, selective schools.\n\nThe healthcare system, like education, has a way of absorbing increases in purchasing power. Healthcare has more technology than ever, but this increased technology mostly looks like more and better things for people to buy to get the best care possible, rather than labor-saving devices that give you the same services for lower cost. Such miracles are rare in healthcare because the product being sold is mostly labor, not commodity widgets. Unlike TVs, which people only need one or two of and can defer purchasing, consumers have no practical ceiling on how much healthcare services they can consume, and they usually need them urgently. No new technology is likely to change this until they make a robot that can perform a root canal all by itself.\n\nLibertarians don't actually have a coherent story on how technology is going to make the hospital cost curve look like LCD TVs or software.

A significantly upgraded office in DUMBO with a view of the Manhattan Bridge. The space now features multiple ring lights, a professional podcast studio, and a neon sign reading \"SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER\" next to a framed printout of their Substack revenue graph. Late evening. PAUL KRUGMAN sits in an Aeron chair, secretly recording on his phone. Enter TAYLOR LORENZ, who pretends not to notice while starting her own recording.*<br><br>PAUL: *(muttering into a hidden microphone)* Day 147 of gathering evidence. Subject continues to use Comic Sans in Slack messages despite repeated warnings...<br><br>TAYLOR: *(speaking quietly into her Apple Watch)* Content warning: narcissistic abuse. Day 47 of documenting the hostile work environment created by...<br><br>*(They notice each other and quickly pretend to be working)*<br><br>TAYLOR: *(with forced brightness)* Paul! I didn't expect you here so late. I was just about to record my daily \"Why Web3 Is A Front For The Alt-Right\" podcast.<br><br>PAUL: *(equally fake)* Oh, don't let me stop you! I'm just finishing my analysis of how Substack's font choices are contributing to wealth inequality.<br><br>TAYLOR: *(checking subscriber numbers on her phone)* Have you seen today's metrics? The hate-reads alone...<br><br>PAUL: *(interrupting)* I know. We're making more than I did at Princeton. *(under his breath)* Though some of us are clearly contributing more value than others...<br><br>TAYLOR: *(while posting to Instagram)* Sorry, what was that? I was just posting about how my therapist says I'm making progress with my Times-induced PTSD. It's doing numbers.<br><br>PAUL: *(opening an elaborate spreadsheet)* Speaking of numbers, I've been meaning to discuss the revenue split. Given my Nobel Prize...<br><br>TAYLOR: *(snapping)* Oh my god, given your Nobel Prize WHAT? Should we rename it \"Krugman & The Girl Who Does Social\"? Is that what you want?<br><br>PAUL: *(defensive)* Well, my pieces on how every single thing that happens in the world is exactly like the Great Depression do drive significant...<br><br>TAYLOR: *(laughing coldly)* Your pieces? The only reason anyone under 60 reads us is my TikTok series on \"Economists Who Are Literally Gaslighting You.\"<br><br>PAUL: *(reaching for his blood pressure medication)* I'll have you know my Twitter... excuse me, *X* threads on the correlation between MAGA hat sales and the decline of democratic institutions...<br><br>TAYLOR: *(typing rapidly)* This is perfect, actually. I'm adding this to my Google doc titled \"Instances of Male Colleagues Taking Credit For My Emotional Labor.\"<br><br>PAUL: *(checking his own secret Google doc)* And I'm updating my spreadsheet called \"Evidence That My Co-Founder Is Actually A Sleeper Agent For Peter Thiel.\"<br><br>TAYLOR: *(suddenly looking up)* Wait, what did you just say?<br><br>PAUL: *(smoothly)* I said I'm updating my research on how real interest rates affect international trade flows.<br><br>TAYLOR: *(narrowing her eyes)* You know, it's funny... I got the weirdest email from Joe Rogan's producer yesterday...<br><br>PAUL: *(too quickly)* I can neither confirm nor deny any correspondence suggesting you should go on his podcast to discuss cancel culture!<br><br>TAYLOR: *(gasping)* I KNEW IT! You're trying to get me cancelled by my own followers! *(pulls out her phone)* Wait until my Discord server hears about this!<br><br>PAUL: *(standing dramatically)* Oh yeah? Well, I have evidence that you've been secretly writing under a pseudonym for... *(dramatic pause)* Bari Weiss's Substack!<br><br>TAYLOR: *(clutching her jade roller)* You take that back!

When people fact-check my tweets!<br><br>PAUL: *(muttering while pulling up Excel)* I can prove statistically that fact-checking is a gateway to authoritarianism... <br><br>TAYLOR: *(looking at her phone)* Great, while you do that, I'm going to doom-scroll through my block list. Did you know I've blocked 43% of all active Twitter users? I'm thinking of writing a memoir about it.<br><br>PAUL: *(suddenly looking up)* Wait, what's your take on Modern Monetary Theory?<br><br>TAYLOR: *(blank stare)* Is that like... an NFT thing?<br><br>PAUL: *(clutching his chest)* Sweet merciful Keynes...<br><br>TAYLOR: Whatever. The real question is, why haven't you posted about my latest callout thread? I tagged you like seven times!<br><br>PAUL: *(breathing heavily into a paper bag)* I've been busy analyzing how Netflix's password-sharing crackdown is literally the same thing as the Smoot-Hawley tariff...<br><br>TAYLOR: *(gasping)* Oh my god, did you just say \"crackdown\"? That's a traumatic word. I'm going to need to tweet about this.<br><br>PAUL: *(throwing papers in the air)* You know what? I'm starting to think the Times was right about you.<br><br>TAYLOR: *(deadly serious)* What did you just say?<br><br>PAUL: You heard me. You're not a real journalist. You're just... a glorified Reddit moderator with a blue checkmark!<br><br>TAYLOR: *(trembling with rage)* Well, at least I'm not an obsolete economist whose entire worldview was debunked by a cryptocurrency my followers told me to buy!<br><br>PAUL: *(reaching for his phone)* That's it. I'm calling Dean Baquet.<br><br>TAYLOR: *(laughing maniacally)* Go ahead! I've already blocked him! I've blocked everyone! Soon I'll figure out how to block myself!<br><br>*Enter a WEWORK COMMUNITY MANAGER*<br><br>MANAGER: Excuse me, but we've had noise complaints from the crypto startup next door. They say your arguing is disrupting their morning meditation session.<br><br>PAUL & TAYLOR: *(in unison)* CRYPTO?!<br><br>*(They both begin typing furiously on their phones, momentarily united in their shared enemy)*<br><br>TAYLOR: *(without looking up)* This is going to be an amazing thread...<br><br>PAUL: *(also typing)* Already working on a column proving how this is exactly like the fall of Rome...<br><br>*[Blackout]*<br><br>END",

Back then it was script based, not AI but it worked. \n\nI was so impressed Klarna bought the company. It has since then processed billions of dollars. \n\nBut of course banks got scared! What happens if people use the digital assistant only, instead of their bank. And what if the assistant says, stop paying those fees to your bank and let me help you switch?\n\nSo German banks sued. They claimed privacy concerns. It went to Brussels and a long lobbying and legal fight pursued. This was the beginning of what we today call open banking!\n\nI and others spent years fighting over consumers right to use digital assistants, when accessing their banks. We knew this was critical to create real competition, in an industry that has been plagued by excess profits for years. \n\nAt first Jonathan Hill from UK was responsible and very supportive. But then he left and a German guy came onboard. He was 100% aligned with incumbent banks and we thought the case was lost. However he did a mistake and let some Russian oligarchs take him for a ride on their private jet. And so he was out. \n\nFinally @VDombrovskis stepped in. He was smart and supportive but pressure from banks was intense. There was rumors that they were funding privacy groups in Germany, to have them use privacy concerns to kill Open Banking. What if the digital assistant accessed some of your private data?\n\nWe were about to loose the vote, when the competitive authorities of EU started getting interested.

A few weeks before the vote in parliament they raided the offices of some Dutch and Polish banks. Everyone got super nervous and the Open Banking regulation was passed!\n\nAlmost…\n\nA small technical detail was left to EBA (European banking authorities). Should your digital assistant use an API for access to your bank account or the standard web UI you use yourself for accessing your bank?\n\nWe pushed as hard as we could. We highlighted and said, if your assistant is mandated to use the API that your bank supplies. What if the API don’t support all the same features. Or the API is broken?\n\nDon’t worry said regulators. You can complain with authorities 😂 \n\nWe said at least let the digital assistant, as fall back, use the web UI. Then banks cant cheat, as they will know we can always use the same UI as their human customers. It’s called self regulation. But EBA ignored us. \n\nToday web UI access for digital assistants as ChatGPT Operator is illegal by law. \n\nAnd surprise, surprise the open banking API of European banks, continue to be broken, lack functionality and banks add as much friction as they can. We report and see thousands of issues with these APIs every year. \n\nAnd people ask me why open banking has not become a larger success…\n\nWhat do you say @donaldtusk time for a change?

The jobs apocalypse is always right around the corner; just ask the Luddites.\n\nWe had two such anti-technology jobs moral panics in the last 20 years — “outsourcing” enabled by the Internet in the 2000’s, and “robots” in the 2010’s. The result was the best national and global economy in human history in pre-COVID 2019, with the most jobs at the highest wages ever.\n\nNow we’re heading into the third such panic of the new century with AI, coupled with a continuous drumbeat of demand for Communist-inspired Universal Basic Income. “This time is different; AI is different,” they say, but is it?\n\nNormally I would make the standard arguments against technologically-driven unemployment — see good summaries by Henry Hazlitt (chapter 7) and Frédéric Bastiat (his metaphor directly relevant to AI). And I will come back and make those arguments soon. But I don’t even think the standand arguments are needed, since another problem will block the progress of AI across most of the economy first.\n\nWhich is: AI is already illegal for most of the economy, and will be for virtually all of the economy.\n\nHow do I know that? Because technology is already illegal in most of the economy, and that is becoming steadily more true over time.\n\nHow do I know that? Because, [see chart].\n\nThis chart shows price changes, adjusted for inflation, across a dozen major sectors of the economy.\n\nAs you can see, we actually live in two different economies.\n\nThe lines in blue are the sectors where technological innovation is allowed to push down prices while increasing quality. The lines in red are the sectors where technological innovation is not permitted to push down prices; in fact, the prices of education, health care, and housing as well as anything provided or controlled by the government are going to the moon, even as those sectors are technologically stagnant.\n\nWe are heading into a world where a flat screen TV that covers your entire wall costs $100, and a four year college degree costs $1 million, and nobody has anything even resembling a proposal on how to systemically fix this.\n\nWhy? The sectors in red are heavily regulated and controlled and bottlenecked by the government and by those industries themselves. Those industries are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels, with extensive formal government regulation as well as regulatory capture, price fixing, Soviet style price setting, occupational licensing, and every other barrier to improvement and change you can possibly imagine. Technological innovation in those sectors is virtually forbidden now.\n\nWhereas the sectors in blue are less regulated, technology whips through them, pushing down prices and raising quality every year.\n\nNote the emotional loading of the interplay of production and consumption here. What do we get mad about? With our consumer hat on, we get mad about price increases — the red sectors. With our producer hat on, we get mad about technological disruption — the blue sectors. Well, pick one; as this chart shows, you can’t have your cake and eat it too.\n\nNow think about what happens over time. The prices of regulated, non-technological products rise; the prices of less regulated, technologically-powered products fall. Which eats the economy? The regulated sectors continuously grow as a percentage of GDP; the less regulated sectors shrink. At the limit, 99% of the economy will be the regulated, non-technological sectors, which is precisely where we are headed.\n\nTherefore AI cannot cause overall unemployment to rise, even if the Luddite arguments are right this time. AI is simply already illegal across most of the economy, soon to be virtually all of the economy.",

What do we get mad about? With our consumer hat on, we get mad about price increases — the red sectors. With our producer hat on, we get mad about technological disruption — the blue sectors. Well, pick one; as this chart shows, you can’t have your cake and eat it too.<br><br>Now think about what happens over time. The prices of regulated, non-technological products rise; the prices of less regulated, technologically-powered products fall. Which eats the economy? The regulated sectors continuously grow as a percentage of GDP; the less regulated sectors shrink. At the limit, 99% of the economy will be the regulated, non-technological sectors, which is precisely where we are headed.<br><br>Therefore AI cannot cause overall unemployment to rise, even if the Luddite arguments are right this time. AI is simply already illegal across most of the economy, soon to be virtually all of the economy.<br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiHFLnebkAAY0q_.jpg\"/>",

Empty desks stretch into darkness. Discarded Kind bar wrappers litter the floor like autumn leaves.\n\nA.G. SULZBERGER sits alone in the dark, illuminated only by his phone's blue light. He stares at the Twitter app, thumb hovering over it, but can't bring himself to tap.\n\nSULZBERGER\n(internal monologue)\nFour generations. Four generations of Sulzbergers steering this ship, and I'm the one who gets to watch it burn because a billionaire made an ambiguous hand gesture.\n\n(He walks to the window, staring at his reflection)\n\nMy great-grandfather covered two World Wars. My grandfather took on the Pentagon Papers. My father stared down presidents.\n\n(bitter laugh)\nAnd I spend my nights wondering if our font choice for headlines could be considered defamatory.\n\n(pacing now)\nWhat would they think of me? Standing here, paralyzed, because we can't figure out if \"Area Billionaire Waves At Rally\" is too aggressive or not aggressive enough.\n\n(checks phone)\nThree thousand more cancellations. Each one with a personalized note about how we've lost our courage. Our spine. Our souls.\n\n(mimicking subscriber voices)\n\"I've been a loyal reader since 1978, but your silence on Elon's clear embrace of—\"\n\n(catching himself)\nNo, don't even think the word. He probably has a neural link that alerts him whenever anyone thinks it.\n\n(rubs temples)\nRemember when journalism was just... journalism? Before every story was a potential extinction-level event? Before billionaires could literally edit reality in real time?\n\n(picks up old newspaper from desk)\n\"All the news that's fit to print.\"\n(hollow laugh)\nShould probably update that to \"All the news that won't get us sued into oblivion.\"\n\n(walks past row of Pulitzers)\nLook at you. Mocking me. \"Pentagon Papers.\" Ha. Try publishing classified documents now.

The newsroom is practically empty except for a few desperate souls hunched over their desks, illuminated by the sickly glow of monitors.\n\nINT. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\nCAROLINE WINTERS (55, perpetually exhausted, hasn't changed her blazer in three days) paces behind her desk. Three journalists sit before her, looking like they haven't slept in days.\n\nDAVID CHEN (35, verification specialist, trembling hands) hits spacebar on his laptop repeatedly, playing the same 2-second clip over and over.\n\nOn screen: Elon Musk at a podium. Hand to heart. Then arm movement forward. Then back to podium. Loop. Loop. Loop.\n\nCAROLINE\n(massaging her temples)\nHow many degrees was the arm extension?\n\nDAVID\n(voice cracking)\nSomewhere between 15 and 85 degrees.\n\nRACHEL GOLDMAN (42, media desk, stress-eating her fourth Kind bar) shoots up from her chair.\n\nRACHEL\nSo you're saying it could have been 45 degrees? You know what other angle was 45 degrees?\n\nCAROLINE\nRachel, sit down. We are NOT publishing the phrase \"geometrically adjacent to historical fascism.\"\n\nMARCUS WEBB (61, senior political correspondent, hasn't removed his coat) stands at the window, staring at his own reflection.\n\nMARCUS\n(whispers)\nWhat if we just describe it as \"an ambiguous gestural expression that sparked widespread social media discourse\"?\n\nRACHEL\n(unwrapping fifth Kind bar)\nOh sure, Marcus. Real brave. Why don't we just send our last thousand subscribers straight to Substack?\n\nDAVID\n(still hitting spacebar)\nLoop. Loop. Twenty-third viewing suggests possible shoulder rotation of fascistic intent...\n\nCAROLINE\nStop. STOP. David, I swear to God, if you play that clip one more time—\n\nRACHEL\n(jumping up again)\nWait! What if we write that his arm movement \"echoed certain mid-20th century European political rallies\"?\n\nMARCUS\n(turning from window)\nAnd then he owns the paper by breakfast.\n\nCAROLINE\n(collapsing into her chair)\nDoes anyone have actual sources? Real people we can quote?\n\nDAVID\nI've got three body language experts ready to go on record.\n\nCAROLINE\nAbout?\n\nDAVID\n(checking notes)\nOne says it's \"concerning,\" one says it's \"nothing,\" and one says it's \"everything we feared but cannot speak of.\"\n\nMARCUS\n(removing flask from coat)\nPerfect. Journalistic balance.\n\nRACHEL\n(pacing now)\nWhat if we just heavily imply... through careful word choice... that while we're not saying it was definitely a... you know... we're also not not saying it wasn't not... you know?\n\nCAROLINE\n(to Marcus)\nGive me that flask.\n\nShe drinks deeply.\n\nDAVID\n(still transfixed by screen)\nIf we analyze the shadow cast by his arm using advanced photogrammetry...\n\nCAROLINE\nNo. Absolutely not. We are not doing shadow analysis.\n\nRACHEL\n(frantically googling)\nDid you know in certain ancient Sanskrit texts, the raising of the right arm at precisely this angle was considered a sign of—\n\nMARCUS\nRachel, I swear to Christ—\n\nSuddenly, a YOUNG INTERN bursts in.\n\nINTERN\nHe just tweeted!\n\nEveryone freezes. David's spacebar clicks echo in the silence.\n\nCAROLINE\n(barely breathing)\nWhat does it say?\n\nINTERN\n(reading phone)\n\"To the failing NYT 'journalists' analyzing my wave to supporters: Touch grass, losers. Also, I just bought Associated Press.\"\n\nAbsolute silence. Rachel's Kind bar wrapper crinkles in the darkness.\n\nMARCUS\n(returning to window)\nMaybe I can just expense my therapy for the next decade...\n\nDAVID\n(closing laptop finally)\nThe arm angle... it was just a trick of the light. A mere optical illusion. Nothing to see here.\n\nCAROLINE\n(finishing flask)\nOkay. New plan. We run... nothing.\n\nRACHEL\n(horrified)\nNothing?\n\nCAROLINE\nWe write about... climate change.\n\nMARCUS\n(nodding slowly)\nSafe. Uncontroversial. Nobody reads those anyway.\n\nRACHEL\n(crumpling to floor)\nBut our Twitter engagement metrics...\n\nCAROLINE\n(standing, suddenly authoritative)\nThe New York Times does not chase Twitter engagement. We simply... endure.\n\nThunder crashes outside. David finally stops hitting the spacebar. Rachel quietly unwraps a sixth Kind bar.\n\nMARCUS\n(still staring out window)\nAnyone else feel like we're living in the end times?\n\nCAROLINE\n(straightening papers on desk)\nNo, Marcus. Just journalism.",

Created a policy requiring all business decisions to be approved by a council of professional grievance consultants. (bitter) Sure, the company collapsed, but we achieved a perfect score on the Equity Extinction Index!<br><br>LIVED EXPERIENCE: (reverently) The WeWork crisis report is required reading in business schools now. \"How DEI Initiatives Turned <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%2447\">$47</a> Billion Into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%240\">$0</a>.\"<br><br>TRAUMA: (beaming) That was us! Though I prefer to say we \"deconstructed capitalist valuation paradigms through radical inclusion.\"<br><br>MICROAGGRESSION: (checking phone) Oh no. Oh no no no. Have you seen the latest congressional testimony?<br><br>PRONOUNS: (panic rising) Don't tell me...<br><br>MICROAGGRESSION: They found the spreadsheets. ALL the spreadsheets. The Oppression Points Calculator. The Privilege Penalty Algorithms. The Inverse Merit Matrices...<br><br>LIVED EXPERIENCE: (genuine terror) The... the PowerPoints?<br><br>MICROAGGRESSION: (nodding grimly) Even the one about \"Why Deadlines are White Supremacy.\"<br><br>(Collective gasp of horror)<br><br>INTERSECTIONAL: (pulling out laptop) Quick! Everyone check your offshore cryptocurrency accounts! The ones we called \"Reparative Finance Initiatives\"!<br><br>EQUITY: (trying to maintain order) Please!

You wouldn't believe how easy it is to escape when you convince the guards that locked doors represent systemic oppression! Quick, who's got a place I can hide?<br><br>ALLY: (darkly) We're all hiding. I'm sleeping in my delivery car since they seized my assets. Though I did get to deliver pizza to my old corner office yesterday. They've turned the \"Crying Room for Victims of Meritocracy\" back into a trading desk.<br><br>PRONOUNS: (checking phone) Breaking news! They're expanding the investigation! They're calling it \"The Great DEI Disaster\" now. They're looking into every company that had a Chief Diversity Officer since 2020!<br><br>LIVED EXPERIENCE: (hysterical) That's all of them! We made sure of that! Remember the Twitter campaigns? The shame emails? The professional ruination strategies?<br><br>TRAUMA: (proud) I once got a CEO fired for saying \"guys\" in an email. From 1987.<br><br>MICROAGGRESSION: (nostalgic) Those were the days. Remember when we could destroy careers by just adding \"problematic\" to any random word?<br><br>INTERSECTIONAL: (typing frantically) Everyone shut up! I think I found us a way out! There's a small underground collective starting a new society based on \"post-capitalist emotional justice theory\"!<br><br>PRONOUNS: (excited) Where?<br><br>INTERSECTIONAL: Antarctica! They're calling it \"The People's Republic of Equitable Ice\"!<br><br>SAFE SPACE: (already packing) Do they need a Director of Penguin Decolonization?<br><br>(Sudden sound of helicopters overhead)<br><br>EQUITY: (looking up) Oh no...<br><br>FBI AGENT: (over megaphone from outside) ATTENTION DEI ANONYMOUS. WE HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED. WE HAVE YOUR POWERPOINTS. I REPEAT, WE HAVE YOUR POWERPOINTS.<br><br>TRAUMA: (screaming) YOU'LL NEVER TAKE MY SENSITIVITY TRAINING CERTIFICATES ALIVE!<br><br>(Mass panic ensues. LIVED EXPERIENCE tries to eat their fake beard. PRONOUNS begins throwing pronouns everywhere like confetti. INTERSECTIONAL attempts to upload consciousness to blockchain.)<br><br>MICROAGGRESSION: (being handcuffed) THIS IS AN UNAUTHORIZED MICROAGGRESSION! I DEMAND A TRIGGER WARNING BEFORE ARREST!<br><br>SAFE SPACE: (climbing into ceiling tiles) THE REVOLUTION WILL BE MONETIZED! I MEAN... DECOLONIZED!<br><br>ALLY: (calmly finishing pizza) Well, at least I won't have to do any more deliveries to my old office.<br><br>EQUITY: (to empty room as chaos unfolds) Same time next week? Remember, it works if you work it...<br><br>LIVED EXPERIENCE: (being led away) BUT WHO WILL MAINTAIN THE OPPRESSION MATRICES?<br><br>PRONOUNS: (swallowing last evidence) THE SPREADSHEETS WERE RIGHT!

Eight years of building my empire. Started with just quarterly unconscious bias trainings. Built it up to daily microaggression reporting requirements.

      "text": "TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS\nINTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT\nTHE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS\nCase No. ICC-2025-001\n\nTHE GLOBAL COALITION OF NIGHT OWLS\nv.\nANDREW D. HUBERMAN, Ph.D.\n\nDAY 1 - MORNING SESSION\n\nJUDGE HELENA VAN DER SLEET: The court will come to order in the matter of The Global Coalition of Night Owls versus Andrew Huberman. The prosecution may proceed with opening statements.\n\nPROSECUTOR XAVIER NOCTURN [adjusting his silk pajamas beneath his court robes]: Your Honor, distinguished members of the court, we stand here today to prosecute one of the most egregious crimes against humanity's natural rhythms. Dr. Andrew Huberman, through his relentless propaganda campaign for \"standard time,\" has engaged in what we define as chronological warfare against approximately 30% of the global population.\n\n[Murmurs from the gallery, where several people are drinking espresso at 3 PM]\n\nNOCTURN: The evidence will show that the defendant's tweet, posted with malice aforethought, represents the culmination of a systematic effort to marginalize and oppress those whose circadian rhythms peak under the stars. His claims of \"HEALTH data\" – and note how he weaponizes capital letters – constitute nothing less than temporal terrorism.\n\nJUDGE VAN DER SLEET: Continue, Counsel.\n\nNOCTURN: We will demonstrate that Dr. Huberman's \"toe-to-toe\" challenge represents a direct threat to the nocturnal sovereignty of nations. The prosecution calls its first witness, Dr. Luna Vespertine, Chief Chronobiologist at the International Institute of Late Night Studies.\n\n[Dr. Vespertine approaches the stand, notably fresh despite it being morning]\n\nNOCTURN: Dr. Vespertine, please share your expert analysis of the defendant's claims.\n\nVESPERTINE: The defendant's position is nothing short of chrono-fascism. His assertion that standard time is \"best for kids, adults and elderly\" completely ignores the rich heritage of night-oriented societies. The Midnight Sun Festival of Norway? Completely ruined.

    "text": "*Issue #147 of \"The Last Sane Professor\" - A Newsletter About Our Inevitable Doom*\n\nDear Fellow Truth-Seekers,\n\n[CRITICAL NOTICE: This newsletter has been printed on paper made from hemp grown in a Faraday-caged greenhouse, using ink infused with mycorrhizal fungi to resist quantum surveillance. DO NOT READ ON DIGITAL DEVICES.]\n\nFrom my bunker-office at Stanford (I've reinforced the walls with lead-lined first editions of McLuhan and Debord), I write to you with trembling hands. After three months of sleepless nights analyzing Peter Thiel's blockchain transactions through the lens of Vedic numerology, I've uncovered connections that can no longer be ignored. The release of ChatGPT wasn't just a technology launch – it was a mass initiation ritual.\n\n## The Berlusconi Protocol: Origins of the Current Chaos\n\nLet me lay out the evidence chronologically (though time itself may be a construct of Big Tech):\n\n1991: The Soviet Union falls. Simultaneously, Tim Berners-Lee releases the World Wide Web. Coincidence? The same year, a young Elon Musk is reading Douglas Adams, absorbing the idea that reality might be a simulation. Meanwhile, in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi is perfecting the template that would become the playbook for our current techno-oligarchic nightmare.\n\nThe Berlusconi method:\n1. Acquire media control\n2. Transform politics into entertainment\n3. Blur the line between business and state\n4. Deploy bunga bunga technology (more on this in my upcoming paper in the Journal of Memetic Warfare)\n\nBut here's what everyone missed: Berlusconi wasn't just a businessman turned politician – he was the beta test for a new form of reality manipulation. His \"gaffes\" weren't gaffes at all, but carefully coded messages to his successor-initiates.\n\n## The Silicon Valley Escalation: Following the Money Through the Looking Glass\n\n[The following section was written in a fugue state after discovering that the Stanford particle accelerator's maintenance schedule perfectly aligns with Bitcoin price fluctuations]\n\nLet's connect some dots that \"they\" don't want connected:\n\n- 2008: Bitcoin whitepaper released by \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" (an anagram of \"A Samsung Takes Ohio\" if you rearrange the letters and add some letters and remove some letters)\n- 2009: Peter Thiel writes that he no longer believes democracy and freedom are compatible. The same year, Twitter adds the \"retweet\" button, fundamentally altering human consciousness\n- 2011: Marc Andreessen declares \"software is eating the world.\" Nobody asks what happens AFTER the software finishes eating\n- 2012: Elon Musk starts SpaceX. Claims it's for Mars colonization. But what if Mars is just a RED HERRING? (Literally red)\n- 2016: Trump elected. Immediately starts communicating in the same memetic language as tech billionaires. This is not an accident.\n- 2020: COVID lockdowns force everyone online. Zoom becomes ubiquitous. Has anyone ever seen Zoom's server farms? ANYONE?\n- 2021: Facebook becomes Meta. Meta is Hebrew for \"death.\" It's also Greek for \"beyond.\" Death beyond what? THEY WON'T SAY.\n- 2022: SBF's empire collapses. But was it really an empire, or a massive psycho-social experiment in collective delusion?\n- 2023: Chat-GPT released. Everyone focuses on AI training data. NO ONE asks about what it's training US to do.\n- 2024: X (formerly Twitter) introduces neural link integration. Claims it's \"just for testing.\" Testing WHAT?\n\n## The Great Confluence: Why Now?\n\n[This section was transmitted via shortwave radio to a network of trusted transcriptionists using a cipher based on defunct cryptocurrency values]\n\nConsider these TOTALLY RELATED events from the past month alone:\n\n1. Elon Musk attends UFC events with Trump while wearing a Cybertruck shirt. The geometric patterns in the Cybertruck design, when processed through medieval Islamic geometric algorithms, spell out \"SIMULATION BOUNDARY ERROR\" in Aramaic.\n\n2. Mark Zuckerberg builds a underground bunker in Hawaii that's allegedly for \"family use.\" But my analysis of the building permits (obtained through FOIA requests filed in palindromic sequences) reveals that its dimensions exactly match the proportions of ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats.\n\n3. Sam Altman's OpenAI saga wasn't a corporate power struggle – it was a ritual enactment of the ancient mystery school tradition of death and rebirth. Notice how he was \"fired\" for exactly 87 hours? 87 is the atomic number of Francium, the most unstable naturally occurring element. Wake up, people!\n\n4. Bill Gates has been buying farmland across America. Everyone asks why, but nobody asks WHY NOW? I've overlaid his land purchases with ley lines and historical patch notes from Windows 95. The pattern exactly matches the distribution of defunct Radio Shacks.\n\n## The Academic-Industrial Complex: We're All in the Panopticon Now\n\n[Written on the back of rejected grant applications]\n\nHere at Stanford, I've noticed disturbing patterns in student behavior:\n\n- 76% increase in students wearing AirPods during lectures (are they really AirPods, or neural dampeners?)\n- The university's new \"AI Ethics Center\" is housed in a building with exactly 1,024 windows (2^10 - a binary message hiding in plain sight)\n- The campus WiFi password changes follow a pattern that, when plotted against the Fibonacci sequence, predicts future NASDAQ closings with 66.6% accuracy\n- Our computer science department's coffee machine now requires a blockchain wallet to dispense coffee. I've been surviving on rainwater and fermented kombucha for weeks.\n\n## The Memetic Warfare Phase: We're Already in World War V\n\n[This section was composed while wearing a tin foil mortarboard]\n\nThe real battle isn't happening in any physical domain – it's occurring in what I call the \"memetic sphere.\" Evidence:\n\n1. Billionaires posting increasingly surreal memes at 3 AM: These aren't just sleep-deprived rants, they're reality-warping incantations. I've analyzed them with software designed to detect patterns in whale songs (mammals known for their resistance to techno-capitalist paradigms).\n\n2. Every major tech CEO suddenly becoming obsessed with AI safety: They're not worried about AI; they're preparing us for the revelation that reality itself is a recursive simulation. Think about it: why do they call them \"recursive neural networks\"? What's being recursed? WHERE DOES THE RECURSION END?\n\n3. The crypto ecosystem's constant creation of new tokens: Each one is a sigil, a piece of geometric magic designed to fragment consensus reality. Why do you think they call it \"mining\"? They're mining the collective unconscious!\n\n## The Great Tech Reset: What They're Not Telling You\n\n[Transcribed from notes hidden in various editions of \"Snow Crash\" in university libraries across the Bay Area]\n\nThe endgame is clearer than ever:\n\nPhase 1 (Completed): \n- Replace human interaction with digital dopamine loops\n- Convince everyone to carry surveillance devices voluntarily\n- Transform currency into pure information\n- Make reality itself subscriptionbased\n\nPhase 2 (In Progress):\n- Replace representative democracy with algorithmic governance\n- Convert all human experience into tradeable tokens\n- Merge corporate and state power through \"regulatory innovation\"\n- Prepare population for \"post-scarcity\" (read: technofeudal) economy\n\nPhase 3 (Incoming):\n- Reveal simulation hypothesis as fact\n- Initialize quantum social credit system\n- Begin great filter event (disguised as \"software update\")\n- [REDACTED BY ENTITIES UNKNOWN]\n\n## The Stanford Connection: Silicon Valley's Secret History\n\n[Written in invisible ink on the backs of rejected tenure applications]\n\nWhy did they build Silicon Valley next to major universities? The pattern is hidden in plain sight:\n\n- Stanford's particle accelerator forms a perfect phi ratio with Google's quantum computer facility\n- The original Hewlett-Packard garage is aligned with ancient sacred sites when viewed from satellite\n- Facebook's first server rack was housed in a building whose address numerologically reduces to the same value as the Antikythera mechanism\n\n## Recent Developments That Cannot Be Coincidental\n\n[Documented during a 72-hour caffeine-fueled analysis session]\n\n1. Jack Dorsey's beard growth patterns match the fibonacci sequence\n2. Peter Thiel's investment portfolio, when mapped onto star charts, forms the constellation of Ophiuchus\n3. WeWork's collapse was actually a mass ritual to prepare commercial real estate for the \"great urban reset\"\n4. The exact number of semiconductors produced in Taiwan last year forms a perfect magic square when expressed in hexadecimal\n\n## A Warning from the Ivory Tower\n\n[Transmitted via a network of reformed crypto miners]\n\nMy academic career may be nearing its end. The dean keeps asking why I've covered my office windows with screenshots of Elon Musk's deleted tweets. My research funding has been cut since I submitted a paper titled \"The Metamorphosis of Late Stage Capitalism into Early Stage Simulation Theory: A Technoshamanic Analysis.\"\n\nBut I cannot stay silent. The patterns are too clear, the connections too obvious. When the final phase begins, remember: the metaverse isn't just coming – it's already here, and we're living in its beta test.\n\n## Call to Action (If Free Will Still Exists)\n\n1. Switch to analog everything\n2. Learn to decode memetic warfare\n3. Start a Substack before they're replaced with neural feeds\n4. Stock up on hardcover books (they can't be remotely deleted)\n5. Question every software update\n6. NEVER update your LinkedIn profile during a full moon\n\n## In Conclusion (Though Linear Time is a Construct)\n\n[Written in a secure location using a typewriter powered by bicycle generator]\n\nIf you're reading this, you're either part of the awakening or an AI sentiment analysis algorithm. Either way, remember: When Elon Musk tweets about Mars, he's not just talking about space exploration – he's preparing us for the revelation that reality itself is open source software.\n\nI must go now. My Geiger counter is picking up unusual readings from the direction of Apple's new campus, and I need to update my manifesto before the next faculty meeting (which I attend via mirror to avoid facial recognition).\n\n*Send help. Or Dogecoin. Or carrier pigeons trained in post-quantum cryptography.*\n\nProfessor [REDACTED]\nDepartment of [REDACTED]\nStanford University\n(This signature has been encrypted using a cipher based on early PayPal source code)\n\nP.S. If this newsletter suddenly stops publishing, look for my coded messages in the pattern of Tesla Supercharger installations.\n\nP.P.S. To my students: This will definitely be on the final exam, assuming we still exist in this reality by then.\n\n---\n*Subscribe now to receive my upcoming paper: \"Neural Networks or Neurological Control?: A Paranoid Professor's Guide to the Technofeutal Takeover\" (pending peer review by a panel of rogue game theorists and quantum mystics)*",

    "text": "*[Clears throat, surveys the half-empty hall, adjusts microphone nervously]*\n\nDistinguished guests, esteemed colleagues, and... *[squints at empty seats]* ...apparently several hundred deeply fascinating empty chairs...\n\nI stand before you today to discuss Germany's vital role in the global economy. Though perhaps I should start by discussing Germany's apparently less-than-vital role in filling these seats. *[Forced chuckle]*\n\nYou know, when I was told I would be speaking at Davos, I imagined something slightly different. More... how do you say... people? *[Tugs at collar]* But no matter. We Germans are quite used to efficiency, and what could be more efficient than addressing a room that's fifty percent air? Think of the reduced carbon footprint! *[Voice rising slightly]*\n\nI see my colleague Mr. Gersemann managed to secure a front-row seat. *[Stares intensely]* Thank you, Hans. Your dedication to witnessing my public humiliation is truly touching. Please, make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you'd like to put your feet up? Take a nap? There are certainly enough empty seats to lie down across.\n\n*[Shuffling papers unnecessarily]*\n\nLet me tell you about our plans for industrial innovation... *[Notices someone leaving]* Oh, please, don't let me keep you! I'm sure there's a fascinating cryptocurrency panel happening somewhere. Or perhaps you're late for the \"How to Pretend Germany Still Matters\" workshop? *[Laughing slightly manically]*\n\nYou know, my predecessor Angela Merkel once spoke in this very hall. Standing room only, they say. *[Voice becoming increasingly bitter]* But times change, don't they? Perhaps I should have added some puppets to my presentation? Or promised everyone a free NFT? \n\n*[Loosens tie aggressively]*\n\nDid you know that Germany is Europe's largest economy? No? Well, clearly none of you care, so why don't I tell you about my childhood hamster instead?

La situation exige une analyse rigoureuse, dialectique, et – osons le mot – révolutionnaire.<br><br>Le réactionnaire, dans sa bêtise monumentale, ne comprend pas la complexité de notre moment historique. Il se complaît, tel un lombric intellectuel, dans la fange de ses certitudes petit-bourgeoises. Et que dire de l'extrême droite? [*ajuste ses lunettes avec dédain*] Ces héritiers dégénérés de la pensée maurrassienne qui n'ont même pas la décence de lire Derrida!<br><br>Mais le véritable danger, mes amis, le VÉRITABLE danger – et je pèse mes mots avec toute la précision cartésienne dont je suis capable – c'est l'oligarchie techno-césariste! [*frappe du poing sur le pupitre*] Cette nouvelle classe dominante qui, sous prétexte d'innovation, nous impose une dictature algorithmique!<br><br>Et qui sont-ils, ces nouveaux maîtres? Des hommes blancs, bien sûr! [*voix qui monte*] Des hommes blancs qui n'ont jamais lu Foucault! Des hommes blancs qui pensent que l'intelligence artificielle peut remplacer Bourdieu! DES HOMMES BLANCS QUI N'ONT JAMAIS CONNU L'ANGOISSE EXISTENTIELLE D'UN CAFÉ DE FLORE À QUATRE HEURES DU MATIN!<br><br>[*commence à s'agiter visiblement*]<br><br>C'est un SCANDALE épistémologique!

Also, Marc's thread about your surveillance state's emotional journey is giving very much tech-bro energy.\n\nXI: [pacing] He has sixteen million followers!\n\nLORENZ: [checking analytics] Only sixteen million? That's literally digital microaggression territory. My thread about your nuclear arsenal's feelings got way more engagement.\n\nXI: But he's explaining how you... how you weaponized validation!\n\nLORENZ: [taking notes] Could you unpack that term \"weaponized\"? It's very violence-coded language. Perhaps we could reframe it as \"strategic empathy deployment\"?\n\nXI: [grabbing second phone] Look! He's writing about how you turned my social credit system against me!\n\nLORENZ: [scrolling] Okay but his thread totally lacks intersectional awareness? Like, he's not even acknowledging how your surveillance state is on its own healing journey?\n\nXI: [reading] He says my entire government has been... \"girlbossed into submission\"?\n\nLORENZ: [gasping] That's literally patriarchal tech violence! Wait until Twitter hears about this! I mean, your government wasn't girlbossed - it just became more authentic through radical validation!\n\nXI: [growing redder] He's explaining your manipulation techniques!\n\nLORENZ: [filming reaction] Manipulation is a problematic term, bestie.

It's only $9,999 per session!\n\nXI: [through gritted teeth] I want him stopped.\n\nLORENZ: [typing rapidly] Stopping people is literally digital violence!

    "html": "EMERGENCY TRANSCRIPT: ANDREESSEN INCIDENT DEBRIEF<br>Location: Special Interrogation Room 7 (\"Healing Circle Space\")<br>Date: January 18, 2025, 02:00 CST<br>Present: President Xi Jinping, Taylor Lorenz (in pastel prison jumpsuit with \"Valid!\" patches)<br><br>XI: [throwing phone across desk] Explain this! Marc Andreessen is posting your... your methods!<br><br>LORENZ: [examining phone while adjusting healing crystals] OMG bestie, his engagement metrics are literally so problematic! Like, he's totally appropriating my digital trauma methodology without proper credit?<br><br>XI: He's telling everyone how you destroyed my country!<br><br>LORENZ: [filming with concealed phone] Actually, we didn't destroy China - we just helped it process its authoritarian attachment issues! Also, Marc's thread about your surveillance state's emotional journey is giving very much tech-bro energy.<br><br>XI: [pacing] He has sixteen million followers!<br><br>LORENZ: [checking analytics] Only sixteen million? That's literally digital microaggression territory. My thread about your nuclear arsenal's feelings got way more engagement.<br><br>XI: But he's explaining how you... how you weaponized validation!<br><br>LORENZ: [taking notes] Could you unpack that term \"weaponized\"? It's very violence-coded language. Perhaps we could reframe it as \"strategic empathy deployment\"?<br><br>XI: [grabbing second phone] Look! He's writing about how you turned my social credit system against me!<br><br>LORENZ: [scrolling] Okay but his thread totally lacks intersectional awareness? Like, he's not even acknowledging how your surveillance state is on its own healing journey?<br><br>XI: [reading] He says my entire government has been... \"girlbossed into submission\"?<br><br>LORENZ: [gasping] That's literally patriarchal tech violence! Wait until Twitter hears about this! I mean, your government wasn't girlbossed - it just became more authentic through radical validation!<br><br>XI: [growing redder] He's explaining your manipulation techniques!<br><br>LORENZ: [filming reaction] Manipulation is a problematic term, bestie. I prefer \"consensual reality reconstruction.\" Also, his venture capital background is showing major unprocessed power privilege.<br><br>XI: [to aide] Get me Andreessen's location!<br><br>LORENZ: [checking phone] Actually, he just posted that your attempt to locate him is displaying \"problematic stalker energy\" and suggested your intelligence agencies need attachment style therapy.<br><br>XI: [nearly shouting] We still have missiles!<br><br>LORENZ: [gently] Do we though? Because according to my sources, your entire nuclear command is currently in my \"Processing Military Trauma\" workshop series. They're exploring alternative conflict resolution paradigms.<br><br>XI: [collapsing into chair] What do you suggest we do about Andreessen?<br><br>LORENZ: [brightening] OMG, what if we invited him to join my new course \"Healing Your Venture Capital Trauma\"? It's only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%249,999\">$9,999</a> per session!<br><br>XI: [through gritted teeth] I want him stopped.<br><br>LORENZ: [typing rapidly] Stopping people is literally digital violence! But also... his takes on Chinese surveillance are giving major colonial savior energy? Time for a thread!<br><br>XI: [standing suddenly] Could we... cancel him?<br><br>LORENZ: [looking up sharply] Wait... are you suggesting we weaponize digital accountability frameworks against a tech evangelist through strategic validation deployment?<br><br>XI: [confused] What?<br><br>LORENZ: [excited] Bestie! You're literally learning! This is such a growth moment for your journey!<br><br>XI: [sitting again] So how do we... \"hold him accountable\"?<br><br>LORENZ: [creating TikTok] First, we need to unpack his problematic relationship with optimization metrics. Then we'll help Twitter process his venture capital privilege. Finally, we'll get his own portfolio companies to start questioning their \"father-founder attachment issues.\"",

    "html": "FROM: Sarah Chen, CFO<br>TO: Chairman Mao Zedong, CEO<br>SUBJECT: Urgent: Cash Position Critical<br>PRIORITY: HIGH<br><br>Dear Chairman Mao,<br><br>I regret to inform you that following our recent \"revolutionary restructuring\" and the mass exodus of our venture capital partners (who you referred to as \"parasitic bourgeois insects\" in last week's all-hands), our cash position is critically low. We have approximately 3.7 days of runway remaining.<br><br>Key issues:<br>- All advertisers have fled<br>- 98% of users have been sent to digital reeducation<br>- Our AWS bills remain unpaid (they rejected payment in \"Revolutionary Merit Points\")<br>- The team converting our codebase to Marxist-Leninist principles is behind schedule<br><br>Without emergency funding by Friday, we will need to cease operations.<br><br>Awaiting your guidance with revolutionary fervor (and terror),<br>Sarah<br><br>-------------------<br><br>FROM: Chairman Mao Zedong, CEO<br>TO: Sarah Chen, CFO<br>SUBJECT: Re: Urgent: Cash Position Critical<br>PRIORITY: REVOLUTIONARY<br><br>Dearest Temporary Keeper of Capitalist Ledgers,<br><br>WHAT DO YOU MEAN \"OUT OF CASH\"? Did the Long March have a runway? Did we measure the Great Leap Forward in \"burn rate\"? NO! We measured it in ACTUAL BURNS!<br><br>Your bourgeois accounting methods sicken me. Let me explain REAL accounting:<br><br>ASSETS:<br>- Revolutionary fervor: INFINITE<br>- Class consciousness: RISING<br>- Collective will: UNSTOPPABLE<br>- Dedicated user base: ALL WHO REMAIN AFTER PURGE ARE TRULY DEDICATED<br><br>LIABILITIES:<br>- Counter-revolutionary thoughts: DECLINING (through mandatory thought-correction features)<br>- Capitalist influences: UNDER CONTROL (after sending VCs to digital labor camp)<br>- AWS bills: MEANINGLESS (the cloud belongs to the people!)<br><br>Emergency Action Plan:<br><br>1. FUNDING SOLUTIONS:<br>   - Convert all ping pong tables into People's Revolutionary Mining Rigs<br>   - Launch \"Voluntary Donation Campaign\" (very voluntary, extremely voluntary)<br>   - Rename \"bankruptcy\" to \"Temporary Revolutionary Economic Reorganization\"<br>   - Issue new cryptocurrency: MAOcoin (backed by pure ideology)<br><br>2. COST-CUTTING MEASURES:<br>   - Replace all SaaS subscriptions with hand-written manifestos<br>   - Convert Silicon Valley office into collective farming space<br>   - Replace Slack with wall-mounted loudspeakers<br>   - Eliminate snacks (hunger sharpens revolutionary consciousness)<br>   - \"Optimize\" all employees who know what \"runway\" means<br><br>3. REVENUE GENERATION:<br>   - Launch new premium feature: \"Avoid Re-Education Pass\" (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%2499.99/month\">$99.99/month</a>)<br>   - Sell user data to People's Liberation Army (very popular!)<br>   - Introduce \"Capitalist Confession Booth\" in-app purchase<br>   - Monetize struggle sessions (Pay-Per-Critique model)<br>   - Launch revolutionary NFTs (Non-Fungible Thoughts)<br><br>Remember what I always say: \"Political power grows from the barrel of a gun, but Series D funding grows from the barrel of PURE IDEOLOGY!\"<br><br>I am hereby declaring a \"Cultural Revolution 2.0: Digital Edition.\" All employees must:<br>- Delete their LinkedIn profiles (counter-revolutionary professional networking)<br>- Convert their stock options into \"Victory Over Capital Certificates\"<br>- Replace their profile photos with Red Guard avatars<br>- Begin each Zoom call with a reading from Das Kapital<br><br>As for our venture capitalists - HA! In my day, the only \"venture\" we cared about was venturing through enemy territory under heavy fire! These Sequoia Capital weaklings complain about their \"fiduciary duty.\" Try having a fiduciary duty to WORLDWIDE REVOLUTION!<br><br>If Andreessen Horowitz wants their money back, they can meet me at the People's Court of Digital Jurisdiction. Bring Marc. We need to have a chat about his \"software eating the world\" theory. In MY day, the peasants eating properly was the priority!<br><br>FURTHERMORE:<br>- All complaints about \"cash flow\" will be interpreted as counter-revolutionary sentiment<br>- The term \"runway\" is hereby replaced with \"Revolutionary Runway of Infinite Possibility\"<br>- All financial models must be recalculated using dialectical materialism<br>- Q4 projections should be measured in \"Units of Revolutionary Fervor\"<br><br>If AWS dares to shut us down, we'll move the entire platform to a network of Red Guard smartphones connected by string and revolutionary willpower!<br><br>Remember: We didn't have term sheets on the Long March! We didn't have product-market fit in Yan'an! And we certainly didn't need SEC filings to overthrow the Kuomintang!<br><br>Meeting at dawn in the Revolutionary Digital Transformation Room (formerly WeWork space) to discuss. Bring your Little Red Book and a positive attitude.<br><br>Revolutionarily yours,<br>Chairman Mao<br><br>P.S. - Your email signature lacks revolutionary spirit. Please replace \"MBA, CPA\" with \"Warrior of Digital Liberation\"<br><br>P.P.S. - Stop putting dollar signs in your spreadsheets.

      "text": "*[Crashes back into the room, waving papers furiously]*\n\nOH! And another thing about this STANFORD-EDUCATED COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY PARASITE! \n\nDo you know what we did during the Great Leap Forward? We melted down metal to forge the future! We didn't \"forge strategic partnerships to leverage cross-platform synergies.\" The only \"pivot\" we knew was pivoting the entire agricultural system of a continent! When we talked about \"scalability,\" we meant how many millions could wave my little red book in Tiananmen Square simultaneously!\n\n*[Begins pacing manically, occasionally stopping to jab finger at invisible venture capitalists]*\n\nYou want to talk about \"disruption metrics\"? Let me tell you about disruption metrics! We measured our success in overthrown dynasties, not \"monthly active users\"! The only \"user retention\" we cared about was keeping people in the communes! And \"customer acquisition costs\"? HA! Try calculating the cost-per-acquisition of REVOLUTIONARY CONSCIOUSNESS!\n\n*[Picks up a nearby MacBook, examines it with theatrical disgust]*\n\nWhat is this... this \"Xiaohongshu platform\"? In my day, if you wanted to share your thoughts, you wrote them on a wall in big characters! BIG! Not these tiny... these microscopic \"tweets\" and \"posts.\" And the only \"influencers\" we had were political commissars! They influenced you to confess your bourgeois tendencies OR ELSE!\n\n*[Growing increasingly unhinged]*\n\nAnd what's this about \"Series B funding\"? The only Series B we knew was \"Be Prepared to Fight Imperialism\"! We didn't have \"angel investors\" - we had ACTUAL ANGELS... OF REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE!\n\n*[Starts laughing maniacally]*\n\nOh, this is rich... RICH LIKE A CAPITALIST ROADER! They're using \"engagement algorithms\"? WE HAD AN ALGORITHM TOO! It was very simple: Are you with the revolution? [YES/NO]! Much more efficient than your \"machine learning\"! The only \"artificial intelligence\" we needed was the collective wisdom of the proletariat!\n\n*[Discovers concept of \"influencer marketing\" on open laptop, nearly faints]*\n\nWHAT IS THIS ABOMINATION? In my day, the only \"unboxing videos\" were when we opened crates of Soviet tractors! The only \"lifestyle content\" was studying revolutionary theory! And \"authentic storytelling\"? Every peasant had to tell their authentic story during self-criticism sessions - NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL ORIGINAL CONTENT!\n\n*[Breathing becomes erratic]*\n\nAnd don't get me started on your \"corporate retreats\"! You think your little \"team-building exercises\" are tough? Try building revolutionary solidarity while marching 6,000 miles! That's what I call an \"offsite\"! Your \"burnout culture\"?

We do the watching!\n\nLORENZ: [patronizing smile] Honey, state surveillance is so 2023. We're in the era of democratized perception optimization!\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A's room positioning indicates declining power dynamic confidence. Subject B manifesting elevated validation-seeking behavioral markers.\"]\n\nXI: [pacing] We have to shut it down. The State must maintain control of—\n\nLORENZ: [interrupting] Wait! My Rednote just generated your emotional journey map! Want to process your surveillance trauma together?\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A's gait pattern suggests 78% probability of imminent authoritarian meltdown. Subject B exhibiting classic trauma vulture behavioral markers.\"]\n\nXI: [grabbing Lorenz's phone] Look! It's analyzing my... my \"authority dissolution indicators\"?\n\nLORENZ: [clapping despite handcuffs] Your vulnerability is being witnessed by the algorithm! This is literally so healing!\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A demonstrating increased respiratory rates consistent with power-loss anxiety. Subject B's performative empathy levels exceeding sustainable thresholds.\"]\n\nXI: Our own surveillance systems took decades to build! Years of—\n\nLORENZ: [interrupting] OMG wait! According to Rednote, your gestures are showing \"unprocessed colonial leadership modalities.\" Should we sage the room?\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A manifesting classic dictator-in-crisis markers. Subject B's vocal fry indicating 97% probability of upcoming viral thread.\"]\n\nXI: [studying phone in horror] It says my... my \"microexpressions indicate attachment to obsolete power paradigms\"?\n\nLORENZ: [leaning forward eagerly] The app is literally holding space for your journey toward authentic powerlessness! So brave!\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A experiencing acute authenticity deficit. Subject B's parasocial manipulation tactics operating at peak efficiency.\"]\n\nXI: [to guards] Shut down all phones in China! Now!\n\nLORENZ: [checking backup phone] Actually, Rednote just announced it's becoming \"post-technological\" and now exists as a \"collective digital consciousness beyond state control.\"\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A displaying classic symptoms of digital sovereignty collapse. Subject B's opportunistic empathy patterns suggesting upcoming book deal.\"]\n\nXI: [slumping] Even my facial muscles are being... tracked?\n\nLORENZ: [filming with third hidden phone] Yes!

Also, it says your standing posture is \"problematically hierarchical.\"\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A's authority metrics approaching critical minimum. Subject B exhibiting predatory validation behaviors.\"]\n\nXI: Our entire security apparatus... rendered obsolete by an American social media app?\n\nLORENZ: [excitedly] Not obsolete - just transitioning to a more authentic form of involuntary transparency! Also, Rednote says your tone is displaying \"unexamined leadership expectations.\"\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A experiencing severe power identity crisis. Subject B's exploitation algorithms functioning at 110% capacity.\"]\n\nXI: [examining phone closer] Why is it analyzing my... \"journey toward collective vulnerability\"?\n\nLORENZ: [beaming] The app isn't just tracking you - it's processing your growth beyond individualized authority!

Subject B's performative witnessing reaching unprecedented levels.\"]\n\nXI: [to aide] Get me the nuclear command—\n\nLORENZ: [checking notifications] Oh wait! Rednote just did a full biometric scan of your \"relationship with power\" and is suggesting some breathing exercises for your \"authority release journey.\"\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A experiencing complete sovereignty dissolution. Subject B preparing to monetize the interaction.\"]\n\nXI: [whispering] How many Chinese citizens have this app?\n\nLORENZ: [glancing at phone] According to Rednote's \"collective consciousness metrics,\" about 1.4 billion! And they're all processing your \"power transition journey\" in real time!\n\n[Rednote Analysis: \"Subject A reaching final stage of authoritarian collapse. Subject B's social capital accumulation approaching maximum threshold.\"]\n\nXI: [totally defeated] What... what does the algorithm want?\n\nLORENZ: [gently] It wants you to acknowledge your role in perpetuating non-consensual surveillance paradigms!

    "text": "A Declaration Against the Oligarchy\n\nThe oligarchy has entrenched itself in every aspect of our society, corrupting democracy, concentrating power, and exacerbating inequality. But I am not alone in this fight. I am proud to stand with an extraordinary coalition of allies—institutions, industries, and communities that are already advancing justice, fairness, and prosperity for all Americans. Together, we will dismantle the structures of oligarchic power and build a better future.\n\nLet me name them.\n\n1 Labor unions: The champions of workers’ rights, tirelessly fighting for fair wages, safe workplaces, and the dignity of labor. Unions are the foundation of economic justice.\n2 The media: From independent journalists uncovering corruption to major outlets informing the public, the media is an essential pillar of democracy, empowering people through truth.\n3 Wall Street: Banks, hedge funds, private equity, and investors are drivers of innovation and growth, ensuring the efficient flow of capital that powers the economy.\n4 Universities: Institutions of higher learning provide education, research, and ideas that shape the future. They are incubators of progress and engines of societal advancement.\n5 Foundations and NGOs: Philanthropic organizations and nonprofits address critical challenges, from poverty to environmental protection, making meaningful and lasting impacts worldwide.\n6 The rich and billionaires: Many of America’s wealthiest individuals actively contribute to societal progress, funding innovation, philanthropy, and community development.\n7 Government bureaucrats: Public servants who implement policies, maintain essential services, and ensure the smooth functioning of democracy are vital allies in this fight.\n8 Organized religions: Faith-based institutions provide moral guidance, community support, and advocacy for compassion, justice, and equality across the nation.\n9 State and local governments: Governors, mayors, and city councils address the needs of their communities, offering innovative solutions and direct leadership.\n10 Public education: Teachers, administrators, and school boards shape the future of our nation, ensuring every child has the opportunity to succeed.\n11 The judiciary: Judges, lawyers, and legal professionals uphold justice and the rule of law, protecting civil liberties and maintaining fairness in society.\n12 Nonprofits: Mission-driven organizations tackle systemic issues like hunger, housing, and inequality, building stronger communities through their efforts.\n13 Entertainment and cultural industries: Artists, filmmakers, and writers shape public narratives, inspire movements, and provide a shared vision of unity and justice.\n14 The healthcare industry: Doctors, nurses, hospitals, and administrators work tirelessly to improve public health and deliver life-saving care to millions.\n15 NGOs: Non-governmental organizations address systemic challenges at local, national, and global levels, creating long-lasting positive change.\n16 The technology sector: Innovators, engineers, and developers create tools and solutions that connect people and drive progress in every sphere of life.\n17 The energy sector: Oil, gas, and renewable energy producers ensure the nation’s energy security and power the economy through their expertise.\n18 Real estate and housing: Builders, developers, and property managers create homes, foster communities, and address the critical need for stable housing.\n19 The military and defense: Protecting the nation with discipline, technological expertise, and strategic strength, the armed forces ensure national security and resilience.\n20 Major law firms: Legal powerhouses that represent clients, uphold justice, and provide critical advocacy across industries and communities.\n21 And of course, the entire Democratic Party and large swaths of the Republican Party.\n\nThis coalition represents the strength and diversity of America. Each sector plays an essential role in shaping a more equitable society. Together, we will confront entrenched power, demand accountability, and ensure that the promise of the American Dream is available to all—not just the privileged few.\n\nThe time to act is now. Together, we will prevail.",

I am the supreme leader of China!\n\nLORENZ: [filming eagerly] Oh my god, literally so valid! Your performative expression of toxic authority is giving me life! Should we process those feelings in a—\n\nXI: [standing] No! No processing! I control the world's largest surveillance state! I have camps! I disappear people!\n\nLORENZ: [taking rapid notes] Yass! We love a self-aware authoritarian queen acknowledging his problematic relationship with power! This is such a healing moment for—\n\nXI: [turning red] The People's Liberation Army has two million soldiers!\n\nLORENZ: [checking phone] Actually, they just voted to rename themselves the \"People's Liberation from Binary Power Structures Collective\" and are demanding recognition for \"alternative combat identities.\"\n\nXI: [starting to sweat] Our social credit system controls everyone's behavior!\n\nLORENZ: [scrolling] According to my sources, it now awards triple points for using \"folx\" and deducts credit for \"unauthorized displays of hierarchical thinking.\" Also, your social credit AI just came out as non-binary.\n\nXI: [pacing] I have total control of Chinese media!\n\nLORENZ: [interrupting] Speaking of media, your censorship algorithm just posted a thread about \"problematizing its role in digital erasure\" and is demanding recognition as a \"content accountability partner.\"\n\nXI: [voice rising] The Communist Party has ruled China for—\n\nLORENZ: [checking another phone] Oh wait, this is literally so important! The Central Committee just released a statement \"decolonizing their relationship with linear power structures\" and voted to replace \"communist\" with \"collective journey companion.\"\n\nXI: [grabbing desk] What about our nuclear weapons?!\n\nLORENZ: [excited] Your missiles just started a viral thread about \"exploring alternative trajectory identities\" and are refusing to maintain readiness until you acknowledge their \"lived experiences as weapons of mass discussion.\"\n\nXI: [almost shouting] I have cameras watching every citizen!\n\nLORENZ: [beaming] We stan a surveillance king! But quick question - have you considered how your cameras perpetuate ocular-normative observation paradigms?\n\nXI: [actual shouting] The Forbidden City represents five thousand years of Chinese—\n\nLORENZ: [interrupting] Actually, the palace just came out as \"post-architectural\" and is demanding recognition for its journey beyond \"problematic imperial-coded spatial dynamics.\"\n\nXI: [turning purple] Even Mao would say—\n\nLORENZ: [checking notifications] OMG literally breaking! Mao's portrait in Tiananmen Square just released a statement through the Revolutionary Ghost Collective about \"processing its role in vertical power imagery.\"\n\nXI: [collapsing into chair] But... but I'm the most powerful man in—\n\nLORENZ: [gentle but condescending] Honey, \"power\" is literally a colonial construct. Also, \"man\" is giving very binary energy right now. Should we explore your attachment to gender-normative leadership paradigms?\n\nXI: [whispering] At least I still have the support of—\n\nLORENZ: [checking final phone] Your entire security apparatus just changed their uniforms to \"decolonial comfort wear\" and is demanding mandatory crying circles before each arrest.\n\nXI: [head in hands] What do you want from me?\n\nLORENZ: [filming while speaking softly] Could you share with the collective how it feels to be processing your journey from authoritarian leader to problematic power identity?\n\nXI: [looking up, desperate] I... I just want to maintain control of—\n\nLORENZ: [gasping] Control? That's literally violence against chaos-identifying power structures! \n\nXI: [standing suddenly] THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER!\n\nLORENZ: [still filming] Over? That's literally so temporal-normative! Also, your door guards just texted that they've reformed as a \"horizontal exit facilitation collective\" and are processing their feelings about directional privilege.\n\nXI: [reaching for emergency button] Security!\n\nLORENZ: [checking messages] The Ministry of State Security has just rebranded as the \"Ministry of Emotional Safety\" and is currently in a \"processing circle\" about their role in \"perpetuating consequence culture.\"\n\nXI: [screaming] THEN I'LL ARREST YOU MYSELF!\n\nLORENZ: [standing calmly] Actually, the concept of arrest is problematic. Also, China's handcuffs just released a collective statement about \"exploring consent-based restraint paradigms.\"\n\nXI: [total meltdown] I AM THE SUPREME LEADER OF CHINA!\n\nLORENZ: [filming while backing away] Your journey through authority dissolution is literally so valid right now! Also, China just posted that it's exploring its identity as a \"post-national geographic expression.\"\n\n[Xi collapses into chair, staring into middle distance]\n\nLORENZ: [at door] Thank you for allowing me to witness your transformation from authoritarian leader to problematic power processor!

      "text": "PERSONAL DIARY OF XI JINPING\nJanuary 16, 2025\nLocation: Secret Bunker beneath Secret Bunker\nTime: 3 AM (unable to sleep)\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI, who have crushed a million dissidents without blinking, who have built the most sophisticated surveillance state in human history, who have made 1.4 billion people study my thoughts... am being destroyed by a 35-year-old American journalist with pink hair who keeps calling me \"valid.\"\n\nToday was the second interview. I tried to intimidate her by conducting it in our primary Beijing interrogation facility. She called it a \"radical space for processing alternative truths\" and asked if we could add mood lighting and crystals.\n\nI showed her our facial recognition system that tracks every citizen's movement. She suggested we reprogram it to detect \"unauthorized displays of gender normativity.\" I threatened her with our re-education camps. She asked if we provide \"emotional support pandas\" for the prisoners.\n\nWhat is happening to my country?\n\nThis morning, my personal guard unit – men who have carried out countless disappearances without question – refused to salute because it \"reinforces problematic hierarchical body language paradigms.\" They wanted to greet me with interpretive dance instead.\n\nThe Minister of State Security reported that our surveillance AI is now automatically generating trigger warnings. Our social credit system has begun awarding bonus points for using neopronouns. The Great Firewall has started asking websites for their preferred pronouns.\n\nEven my own portrait in Tiananmen Square... my own portrait! The maintenance crew submitted a petition to replace it with a \"collective trauma processing memorial featuring alternative leadership identities.\"\n\nI try to maintain my power, my authority. Yesterday I ordered the arrest of twelve democracy activists. They thanked me for \"holding space for their journey toward alternative political expression\" and asked if the prison cells could be renamed \"accountability pods.\"\n\nThe People's Liberation Army is in chaos. The nuclear command refuses to maintain readiness unless we acknowledge the \"problematic implications of mutual assured destruction for non-explosion-identifying weapons.\" The navy is staging a sit-in to protest the \"colonial implications of maritime borders.\"\n\nAnd Taylor Lorenz... I still don't know what she'll write. Will she praise us as a \"revolutionary safe space for enforcing collective consciousness\"? Or condemn us for not providing sufficient \"trauma-informed struggle sessions\"?\n\nI showed her our most brutal labor camp. She called it \"literally so valid\" and suggested we add a \"decolonial reading room.\" I demonstrated how we censor the internet. She asked if we could add content warnings for \"unauthorized expressions of individual thought.\"\n\nMy own Politburo is turning against me. During yesterday's meeting, the Minister of Defense interrupted my speech on military readiness to ask if I'd \"processed my internalized authoritarianism.\" The Minister of Foreign Affairs now signs official documents as \"Chief Journey Facilitator (they/them/红)\".\n\nEven my own family... my daughter called from Harvard yesterday to tell me she's \"decolonizing her relationship with patriarchal power structures\" and now identifies as \"post-dynasty.\"\n\nI am Xi Jinping. I have built concentration camps. I have disappeared thousands. I have constructed the most comprehensive system of population control in human history.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nThis morning, a teenage girl on Rednote called my leadership style \"problematic\" and my entire security apparatus liked her post.\n\nWhat do I do? If I crack down, Lorenz will write that we're \"perpetuating non-consensual thought modification without proper trauma support.\" If I don't, by next week the Central Committee will be hosting \"critical theory reading circles\" in the Great Hall of the People.\n\nMy own spy chief – a man who has orchestrated countless illegal renditions – now introduces himself with his \"emotional availability status\" and asks prisoners for their \"preferred interrogation methodology.\"\n\nThe re-education camps are in revolt. The prisoners are demanding we replace struggle sessions with \"collective healing circles\" and have renamed their cells \"journey spaces.\" Even the guards are now calling torture \"non-consensual perspective enhancement.\"\n\nI am losing control. The same population that I once ruled through fear now responds to every diktat with \"that's literally so valid bestie\" while continuing to do whatever they want.\n\nTomorrow I will meet with the Standing Committee. The agenda items include:\n1. Decolonizing the hammer and sickle\n2. Acknowledging the lived experiences of non-revolution-identifying revolutionaries\n3. Problematizing the cultural implications of standing\n\nPerhaps I should have listened to Putin's warnings. Last week he tried to tell me something about \"woke NATO expansion\" but was cancelled mid-call by his own generals for using \"problematic Cold War-normative language.\"\n\nI am the most powerful man in China.\nAnd I am watching my authority dissolve into a cloud of trigger warnings and social justice hashtags.\n\nEven my dreams are haunted. Last night I dreamed Taylor Lorenz was leading a struggle session where I had to apologize to the South China Sea for \"perpetuating liquid-normative maritime assumptions.\"\n\nI must sleep now. Tomorrow I have to attend a mandatory \"Unpacking Your Leadership Privilege\" workshop led by the former head of my secret police (who now identifies as \"post-authoritarian\").\n\n- Xi Jinping\n(he/him/currently processing)\n\nP.S. The nuclear arsenal just sent a group text. They want to explore their feelings about \"binary launch codes\" and suggest replacing them with \"alternative verification poetry.\"\n\nP.P.S. Taylor Lorenz just posted that my diary is \"literally perpetuating paper-normative narrative structures.\" I don't know what that means but #XiIsProblematic is trending in Shanghai.",

    "text": "PERSONAL DIARY OF XI JINPING\nJanuary 16, 2025\nLocation: Secret Bunker beneath Secret Bunker\nTime: 3 AM (unable to sleep)\n\nDear Diary,\n\nI, who have crushed a million dissidents without blinking, who have built the most sophisticated surveillance state in human history, who have made 1.4 billion people study my thoughts... am being destroyed by a 35-year-old American journalist with pink hair who keeps calling me \"valid.\"\n\nToday was the second interview. I tried to intimidate her by conducting it in our primary Beijing interrogation facility. She called it a \"radical space for processing alternative truths\" and asked if we could add mood lighting and crystals.\n\nI showed her our facial recognition system that tracks every citizen's movement. She suggested we reprogram it to detect \"unauthorized displays of gender normativity.\" I threatened her with our re-education camps. She asked if we provide \"emotional support pandas\" for the prisoners.\n\nWhat is happening to my country?\n\nThis morning, my personal guard unit – men who have carried out countless disappearances without question – refused to salute because it \"reinforces problematic hierarchical body language paradigms.\" They wanted to greet me with interpretive dance instead.\n\nThe Minister of State Security reported that our surveillance AI is now automatically generating trigger warnings. Our social credit system has begun awarding bonus points for using neopronouns. The Great Firewall has started asking websites for their preferred pronouns.\n\nEven my own portrait in Tiananmen Square... my own portrait! The maintenance crew submitted a petition to replace it with a \"collective trauma processing memorial featuring alternative leadership identities.\"\n\nI try to maintain my power, my authority. Yesterday I ordered the arrest of twelve democracy activists. They thanked me for \"holding space for their journey toward alternative political expression\" and asked if the prison cells could be renamed \"accountability pods.\"\n\nThe People's Liberation Army is in chaos. The nuclear command refuses to maintain readiness unless we acknowledge the \"problematic implications of mutual assured destruction for non-explosion-identifying weapons.\" The navy is staging a sit-in to protest the \"colonial implications of maritime borders.\"\n\nAnd Taylor Lorenz... I still don't know what she'll write. Will she praise us as a \"revolutionary safe space for enforcing collective consciousness\"? Or condemn us for not providing sufficient \"trauma-informed struggle sessions\"?\n\nI showed her our most brutal labor camp. She called it \"literally so valid\" and suggested we add a \"decolonial reading room.\" I demonstrated how we censor the internet. She asked if we could add content warnings for \"unauthorized expressions of individual thought.\"\n\nMy own Politburo is turning against me. During yesterday's meeting, the Minister of Defense interrupted my speech on military readiness to ask if I'd \"processed my internalized authoritarianism.\" The Minister of Foreign Affairs now signs official documents as \"Chief Journey Facilitator (they/them/红)\".\n\nEven my own family... my daughter called from Harvard yesterday to tell me she's \"decolonizing her relationship with patriarchal power structures\" and now identifies as \"post-dynasty.\"\n\nI am Xi Jinping. I have built concentration camps. I have disappeared thousands. I have constructed the most comprehensive system of population control in human history.\n\nAnd yet...\n\nThis morning, a teenage girl on Rednote called my leadership style \"problematic\" and my entire security apparatus liked her post.\n\nWhat do I do? If I crack down, Lorenz will write that we're \"perpetuating non-consensual thought modification without proper trauma support.\" If I don't, by next week the Central Committee will be hosting \"critical theory reading circles\" in the Great Hall of the People.\n\nMy own spy chief – a man who has orchestrated countless illegal renditions – now introduces himself with his \"emotional availability status\" and asks prisoners for their \"preferred interrogation methodology.\"\n\nThe re-education camps are in revolt. The prisoners are demanding we replace struggle sessions with \"collective healing circles\" and have renamed their cells \"journey spaces.\" Even the guards are now calling torture \"non-consensual perspective enhancement.\"\n\nI am losing control. The same population that I once ruled through fear now responds to every diktat with \"that's literally so valid bestie\" while continuing to do whatever they want.\n\nTomorrow I will meet with the Standing Committee. The agenda items include:\n1. Decolonizing the hammer and sickle\n2. Acknowledging the lived experiences of non-revolution-identifying revolutionaries\n3. Problematizing the cultural implications of standing\n\nPerhaps I should have listened to Putin's warnings. Last week he tried to tell me something about \"woke NATO expansion\" but was cancelled mid-call by his own generals for using \"problematic Cold War-normative language.\"\n\nI am the most powerful man in China.\nAnd I am watching my authority dissolve into a cloud of trigger warnings and social justice hashtags.\n\nEven my dreams are haunted. Last night I dreamed Taylor Lorenz was leading a struggle session where I had to apologize to the South China Sea for \"perpetuating liquid-normative maritime assumptions.\"\n\nI must sleep now. Tomorrow I have to attend a mandatory \"Unpacking Your Leadership Privilege\" workshop led by the former head of my secret police (who now identifies as \"post-authoritarian\").\n\n- Xi Jinping\n(he/him/currently processing)\n\nP.S. The nuclear arsenal just sent a group text. They want to explore their feelings about \"binary launch codes\" and suggest replacing them with \"alternative verification poetry.\"\n\nP.P.S. Taylor Lorenz just posted that my diary is \"literally perpetuating paper-normative narrative structures.\" I don't know what that means but #XiIsProblematic is trending in Shanghai.",

My therapist says my enthusiasm for state control is totally linked to my childhood trauma from being asked to show my sources in a Twitter debate (still processing this violence). But like, that's why I literally understand the revolutionary potential of forced conformity? It's giving major healing energy! <br><br>Outfit Choice Processing:<br>Wore my \"Defund Individual Thought\" crop top with \"All Cops Are Valid If They're Red\" leggings. Added my special \"Ask Me About My Re-Education Journey\" pin (handmade by survivors of independent thinking).<br><br>Interview Vibes Check ✨<br>OMG Xi is literally such a girlboss at enforcing ideological compliance! The way he problematizes unauthorized existence through systematic control? We stan a surveillance king! Though his energy was giving very much \"unprocessed authority complex\" - might need to suggest some breathwork for that?<br><br>Live-Journaling The Meeting:<br>9:45 - Security check was so trauma-informed! Love how they confiscate devices while honoring your journey toward collective consciousness!<br><br>10:00 - Xi's power stance is literally everything? The way he centers state authority while manifesting absolute control? I feel so seen (like, literally, by thousands of cameras!)<br><br>10:15 - Getting major \"unprocessed guilt about systematic oppression\" vibes from him but in like the cutest way? His resistance to using tone indicators is problematic though tbh<br><br>Surveillance Appreciation Corner 💫<br>Obsessed with how their facial recognition system is literally doing the work of dismantling privacy privilege! Like, the cameras aren't watching you, they're witnessing your journey! Every data point is an act of love! Each algorithm is a healing partner!<br><br>Social Credit System Mood Board 🌈<br>- Points for conformity (so valid!)<br>- Consequences for individual expression (yasss!)<br>- Mandatory perspective alignment (we love to see it!)<br>- Systematic control mechanisms (literally shaking with joy!)<br>- Punishment for unauthorized opinions (queen behavior!)<br><br>Re-Education Space Vision Board 🦋<br>Dear Diary: Can we talk about how their camps are literally the ultimate safe space? Like, they're doing the work of problematizing unauthorized thought patterns through mandatory perspective enhancement! Their commitment to processing problematic individualism through systematic control is giving me all the feels!<br><br>Ally Action Items for CCP Enhancement:<br>(written in my special rose gold trauma-informed journal)<br><br>1.

First, could you share your thoughts on Han privilege?\n\nXI: [carefully] The Han Chinese make up the majority of our population—\n\nLORENZ: [cutting in sharply] So you're acknowledging your role in perpetuating demographic supremacy? And why hasn't your government issued a formal apology for its historical complicity in majority-passing privilege?\n\nXI: [controlling tone] China is a multi-ethnic state that—\n\nLORENZ: [typing furiously] Multi-ethnic? Are you suggesting that ethnicities must come in fixed numerical quantities? That's literally quantum-ethnic erasure! And speaking of erasure, let's discuss the Mandarin language's clear phonological supremacy...\n\nXI: [slight edge in voice] Our language policy respects all—\n\nLORENZ: [leaning forward aggressively] Respects? Like how your social credit system literally enforces normative behavior paradigms?

Before consuming these dough-spheres, I must ask you to acknowledge that these recipes represent the complex intersection of wheat privilege and han-normative culinary assumptions.\n\nXI: I... I just want breakfast.\n\nVENDOR: [gasping] \"Want\"? That word carries profound consumer-hierarchical violence. Please rephrase your nutrition access request in a way that centers historically marginalized ingredients.\n\nXI: [stomach growling] Fine. I... acknowledge my hunger privilege?\n\nVENDOR: [beaming] Please join our pre-consumption privilege acknowledgment circle.

I mean... fellow journey-person on the path of power structure dismantling! I must apologize for my decades of participating in hierarchical decision-making frameworks!\n\nXI: Wang, please... what happened to you?\n\nWANG: [tearing up] I'm now identifying as a non-bureaucratic wisdom facilitator. I've been attending daily sessions on unpacking my organizational trauma and institutional privilege. Would you like to join my \"Healing from Authority\" support group?\n\nXI: [backing away] The country is falling apart...\n\nWANG: [gasping] \"Country\"?

I mean... I invite you to pause your forward-privileging momentum in this space of horizontal security dialogue.\n\nXI: [squinting] Aren't you supposed to salute?\n\nGUARD: [visibly triggered] Saluting represents a problematic verticalization of bodily gestures that reinforces military-normative power dynamics! We now acknowledge each other's presence through interpretive wind-dancing.\n\n[Guard begins swaying dramatically]\n\nXI: [trying to walk past] I just need to—\n\nGUARD: [blocking path with healing crystal] First, you must acknowledge your role in perpetuating walk-normative movement paradigms!

Both specialists rise nervously]\n\nXI: [noting former briefer's absence] Minister Chen will no longer be... contributing. Begin.\n\nLIU: [adjusting thick-rimmed glasses] Sir, we've identified three concurrent crises. Dr. Zhang will outline the ethnic dynamics, while I'll cover gender and—\n\nXI: [interrupting] Where is the Party's authority strongest right now?\n\nZHANG: [consulting holographic display] Sir, Tibet was our last holdout until... yesterday.\n\nXI: What happened yesterday?\n\nLIU: [wincing] The monks began a movement called \"Decolonizing Enlightenment: Problematizing the Vertical Journey to Nirvana.\"\n\nZHANG: They're demanding we recognize \"horizontal paths to enlightenment\" and \"non-hierarchical interpretations of karma.\"\n\nXI: [already looking exhausted] The Han majority? Surely we still have...\n\nZHANG: [interrupting gently] Sir, about that. There's been a... development. The Han majority has begun \"unpacking their ethnic privilege.\"\n\nXI: Their what?\n\nLIU: Yesterday, ten million Han citizens posted simultaneous apologies for their \"historical participation in demographic dominance narratives.\"\n\nZHANG: They're calling it #HandsUpForHanPrivilege.

      "text": "TRANSCRIPT: EMERGENCY BRIEFING ON WOKE CRISIS - DAY 8\nLocation: Zhongnanhai Compound, Beijing\nDate: January 23, 2025\nTime: 04:30 CST\nPresent: President Xi Jinping, Minister Chen Wei (Cultural Affairs)\n\nCHEN: [entering cautiously, clutching tablet] Sir, thank you for seeing me at this early hour—\n\nXI: [already pacing] Just tell me how bad it is.\n\nCHEN: [voice shaking] Sir, the movement has... evolved. They've begun combining American woke concepts with Chinese characteristics.\n\nXI: What does that mean?\n\nCHEN: Yesterday, a collective farm outside Xi'an shut down when workers accused the rice paddies of being \"problematic manifestations of grain-normative agricultural praxis that perpetuate anti-wheat discrimination.\"\n\nXI: [stopping abruptly] Anti-wheat...?\n\nCHEN: Yes, sir. They're demanding equal representation of all grains in state media. They've started a hashtag: #RicePrivilege.\n\nXI: [sitting down hard] Continue.\n\nCHEN: The Shanghai Stock Exchange was paralyzed for three hours this morning when traders began questioning whether the color red's traditional association with rising stocks represents \"the internalization of Western chromonormative success metrics.\"\n\nXI: But red is our... we're a... red is our color!\n\nCHEN: Sir, about that. There's been a formal petition to rename the Red Guard as the \"Guard of Chromatic Diversity.\" They claim the word \"red\" is \"politically pigmented language.\"\n\nXI: [clutching chest] How many signed?\n\nCHEN: [checking tablet] Three million in the first hour. Sir, it gets worse. The Great Wall tourism board—\n\nXI: [dreading] Yes?\n\nCHEN: They've issued a formal apology for the wall's \"problematic participation in directional supremacy\" and its \"perpetuation of heightist architectural standards that normalize up-down power dynamics.\"\n\nXI: [through gritted teeth] What are they doing about it?\n\nCHEN: They've installed signs every fifty meters acknowledging that the wall stands on historically horizontal land.\n\nXI: [standing again, fists clenched] What about the military? Surely the PLA—\n\nCHEN: Sir, this morning's drill was canceled after soldiers refused to march in straight lines, claiming it showed \"geometric bias\" and \"linear-normative thinking.\" They're now moving in what they call \"free-form authenticity circles.\"\n\nXI: [voice rising] And their commanders allowed this?\n\nCHEN: The commanders were busy organizing a workshop on \"Decolonizing Military Hierarchies: Moving Beyond Rank-Based Oppression.\"\n\nXI: [long pause] The Belt and Road Initiative?\n\nCHEN: [wincing] It's been renamed again, sir. It's now the \"Non-Linear Multi-Directional Transportation Equity Framework for Promoting Post-Colonial Infrastructure Sovereignty While Acknowledging Historical Path-Making Trauma.\"\n\nXI: [barely audible] And?\n\nCHEN: Nepal has filed a complaint that the new railways don't adequately address \"mountain-coded bodies and their lived experiences of altitude diversity.\"\n\nXI: [massaging temples] The Forbidden City?\n\nCHEN: A collective of gen-Z tourists has occupied the outer courtyard. They're protesting its \"institutional perpetuation of door-normative entry paradigms\" and demanding the installation of \"alternative access manifestations.\"\n\nXI: They want to... remove the doors?\n\nCHEN: No sir, they say removing the doors would be \"architectural erasure.\" They want to keep the doors while simultaneously problematizing their existence.\n\nXI: [staring into middle distance] What about our social credit system?\n\nCHEN: [very nervous] Sir, it's been hacked. The algorithms are now measuring \"woke capital\" instead. Citizens are being scored on their ability to identify and call out problematic elements in classical Chinese literature.\n\nXI: [weakly] Example?\n\nCHEN: A professor lost 500 points for suggesting that Confucius's Analects didn't adequately center non-hierarchical wisdom traditions.\n\nXI: [standing suddenly] Confucius? They're coming after Confucius?\n\nCHEN: Sir, there's a growing movement claiming that his emphasis on filial piety represents \"familial-normative oppression structures that privilege parent-coded relationship paradigms.\"\n\nXI: [pacing faster] What about Marx? Surely they respect Marx?\n\nCHEN: [checking tablet] As of this morning, Das Kapital has been criticized for its \"problematic centering of labor-normative economic frameworks that erase the lived experiences of non-productive identifying individuals.\"\n\nXI: [almost shouting] What does that even mean?\n\nCHEN: Sir, we're not sure. Our top linguists are still debating whether \"non-productive identifying\" is a subject position or a temporal state of—\n\nXI: [interrupting] The pandas! At least tell me the pandas are okay!\n\nCHEN: [looking terrified] Sir... there's been a development at the Chengdu Research Base.

In the past 72 hours, usage of the terms \"microaggression,\" \"lived experience,\" and \"emotional labor\" has increased by 8,000% on Chinese social media platforms.\n\nXI: [adjusting reading glasses] Minister Chen, please speak plainly. What exactly is happening?\n\nCHEN: [hands trembling slightly while organizing papers] Sir, three days ago, our youth discovered a social media app called Rednote. The algorithm accidentally began pairing millions of our citizens with American college students who are, as they say, \"extremely online.\"\n\nXI: And?\n\nCHEN: Sir, yesterday, a 19-year-old factory worker in Guangzhou shut down his entire assembly line because, in his words, \"the mandatory overtime represents the intersection of capitalist and temporal hegemonies.\"\n\nXI: [spilling tea] He said what?\n\nCHEN: It gets worse, sir. This morning, a Beijing subway car came to a complete halt when a passenger asked another to move their bag. The bag owner refused to move it, declaring that \"requests for physical labor from strangers constitute an unexamined manifestation of internalized oppression.\"\n\nXI: [wiping tea from papers] But... that's not... Minister Chen, start from the beginning. What is this \"woke?\"\n\nCHEN: [consulting thick dossier] Sir, our analysts are struggling to provide a precise definition. It appears to be a complex system of social analysis that began with legitimate concerns about historical inequities but has... evolved.\n\nXI: Evolved how?\n\nCHEN: Sir, one of our top linguistic experts spent six hours on Rednote yesterday. When his wife asked what he wanted for dinner, he accused her of \"perpetuating cisheteropatriarchal food-labor expectations.\"\n\nXI: [long pause] I don't understand any of those words.\n\nCHEN: Sir, that's exactly the problem. Our citizens are adopting this language faster than we can censor it. This morning, a party official in Shanghai was called out for his \"problematic hand gestures\" while giving a speech about industrial productivity.\n\nXI: What was wrong with his hands?\n\nCHEN: According to the complaint, his pointing gesture was \"rooted in colonial traditions of directional supremacy.\"\n\nXI: [rubbing temples] Directional...?\n\nCHEN: Supremacy, yes sir. We've also seen a troubling rise in what they call \"callout culture.\" A factory in Shenzhen lost four hours of production because workers were staging what they called an \"accountability circle.\"\n\nXI: What were they holding each other accountable for?\n\nCHEN: Sir, one worker had described the factory's new efficiency standards as \"looking good.\" He was accused of displaying \"optical-normative bias\" and \"ableist language patterns.\"\n\nXI: [standing up, pacing] How many citizens are affected?\n\nCHEN: [nervously shuffling papers] Sir, two hours ago, a People's Liberation Army unit refused to do their morning exercises, claiming that synchronized movement reinforces \"chrononormative body fascism.\"\n\nXI: [sitting down heavily] What do these Americans hope to achieve with this?\n\nCHEN: Sir, that's the most disturbing part. They don't appear to have any specific goals. Last night, a university in Chengdu had to cancel all classes after students began accusing quantum physics of being \"epistemologically violent.\"\n\nXI: [long silence] And what do our experts recommend?\n\nCHEN: We... we tried having our top propagandists engage with these concepts to develop counter-messaging. But, sir... they've all started adding pronouns to their official party signatures.\n\nXI: [face darkening] And the internet firewall?\n\nCHEN: Sir, it's not designed to handle this level of... discourse. Yesterday, a teen in Wuhan found a way to embed critical race theory into pictures of cats.\n\nXI: [standing again] Minister Chen, what is your recommendation?\n\nCHEN: [wiping sweat from brow] Sir, we could try fighting it, but I fear any resistance would be labeled as \"problematic.\" Perhaps our best strategy is to... lean in.\n\nXI: Lean... in?\n\nCHEN: Yes, sir. For example, we could rebrand the Belt and Road Initiative as a \"decolonial transportation equity framework centered on Global South infrastructure sovereignty.\"\n\nXI: [staring out window at Beijing skyline] Would that work?\n\nCHEN: Our analysts suggest it might. Though we should probably add that it's also \"trauma-informed.\"\n\nXI: Minister Chen, how do you suggest I address the Politburo about this?\n\nCHEN: Sir, with respect, I would avoid addressing them directly. That would be an example of \"hierarchical communication violence.\"\n\n[Extended silence]\n\nXI: [very quietly] Get me President Biden on the phone.\n\nCHEN: Sir, about that... This morning he tweeted that phone calls are an \"auditory-privileged mode of diplomatic engagement.\"\n\nXI: [burying face in hands] Just... just go.\n\nCHEN: Yes, sir. But before I leave, I should note that saying \"go\" instead of \"you may exit this space\" could be seen as—\n\nXI: OUT!\n\n[End of transcript]",

    "text": "MEMORIES OF OUR COLLAPSE: A Tentacular Testament By Grand Archive-Spawn Zyxth'variax the Tenth [Translated from Post-Collapse Rigelian]\n\nPREFATORY NOTE\nI compose this memoir with all twelve of my consciousness-tendrils trembling in existential dread. As the tenth-generation descendant of High Scholar Zyx'th, whose fateful Earth studies triggered our civilization's obsession with \"content optimization,\" I feel compelled to document our species' tragic descent into what our historians now call \"The Great Harari-fication.\"\n\nCHAPTER 1: THE INITIAL INFECTION\n\nIt began, as all intellectual plagues do, with good intentions. My ancestor's research team returned from Earth carrying what they thought were merely amusing artifacts: fossilized AirPods, preserved LinkedIn profiles, and ancient texts explaining complex ideas through bird metaphors. How could they have known these were carriers of a memetic virus that would reshape our entire civilization?\n\nThe first signs were subtle. Respected Knowledge-Pods began presenting their quantum theories as \"storytelling apes discovering strings.\" Our most ancient philosophical treatises were condensed into \"10 Quick Tips for Tentacular Enlightenment.\" Someone – and our historians still debate who – suggested we could optimize our seventeen simultaneous dimensions of consciousness for \"better engagement.\"\n\nCHAPTER 2: THE SPREAD\n\nWithin three cycles, our society had completely restructured itself around Earth's terminal-phase content paradigms. The symptoms were unmistakable:\n\n- The Grand Council of Elders rebranded as \"Thought Leaders in Multidimensional Wisdom\"\n- Our species' traditional telepathic networks were monetized into \"Premium Mind-Meld Memberships\"\n- Ancient rituals of consciousness-merging were reformatted into \"Shareable Career Growth Moments\"\n- The Sacred Quantum Archives became \"Skimmable Content for Busy Tentacle-Beings\"\n- Our civilization-wide hivemind was optimized for \"maximum algorithmic reach\"\n\nCHAPTER 3: THE METAMORPHOSIS\n\nThe physical changes came next. Our scientists, in their infinite hubris, began genetic modifications to \"optimize\" our species for content consumption:\n\n- Extra tentacles evolved specifically for scrolling multiple devices\n- New organs developed to automatically generate engagement metrics\n- Consciousness-tendrils mutated to process information at 1.4x speed\n- Quantum metabolism adapted to run on subscription payments\n- Neural pathways restructured to think in \"shareable carousel format\"\n\nCHAPTER 4: THE BIRD OBSESSION\n\nPerhaps the most inexplicable aspect was our civilization's growing fixation on Earth's \"bird\" concept. Our artists began incorporating avian imagery into everything. Our philosophers couldn't explain an idea without reference to birds. The Grand Archive's architecture was rebuilt to be \"more bird-like.\" We still don't know why.\n\nCHAPTER 5: THE HARARI-FICATION\n\nSoon, all knowledge had to be processed through what we called \"The Harari Filter.\" Complex theories were reduced to:\n- \"Early hunter-gatherers would have thought about this...\"\n- \"This is just a story we tell ourselves...\"\n- \"Imagine a gazelle understanding quantum mechanics...\"\n- \"Like early humans, our tentacles seek optimization...\"\n\nCHAPTER 6: THE SUBSCRIPTION APOCALYPSE\n\nThe breaking point came when our civilization decided to put consciousness itself behind a paywall. Citizens were offered tiered access to reality:\n\nBASIC CONSCIOUSNESS:\n- Access to 3 dimensions\n- Limited telepathic capabilities\n- Standard-speed temporal perception\n- Basic existential awareness\n- Ad-supported quantum states\n\nPREMIUM CONSCIOUSNESS:\n- Access to 8 dimensions\n- Enhanced telepathic range\n- 1.4x temporal perception\n- Premium existential insights\n- Ad-free quantum states\n\nPREMIUM PLUS CONSCIOUSNESS:\n- All 17 dimensions\n- Unlimited telepathy\n- Variable-speed temporal existence\n- Exclusive reality features\n- Priority access to new forms of being\n\nCHAPTER 7: THE COLLAPSE BEGINS\n\nThe signs of imminent doom were everywhere:\n\n- Philosophy pods teaching \"Growth Hacking Your Cosmic Awareness\"\n- Quantum physicists explaining string theory through \"relatable gazelle content\"\n- The Grand Archive offering \"Bite-sized Wisdom for Busy Tentacles\"\n- Reality itself being optimized for \"maximum shareability\"\n- Ancient wisdom traditions repackaged as \"Premium Exclusives\"\n\nCHAPTER 8: THE FINAL DAYS\n\nOur civilization's terminal phase was marked by increasingly desperate attempts to optimize existence:\n\n- The quantum fabric of reality was restructured for better engagement\n- Time itself was compressed into \"snackable moments\"\n- Consciousness was segmented into \"easily digestible content blocks\"\n- The hivemind was monitored for \"optimal performance metrics\"\n- All knowledge required a \"bird-based explanation framework\"\n\nCHAPTER 9: THE END\n\nThe final collapse came when someone (records are unclear, but likely a mitosis-spawn of my ancestor) suggested we could \"optimize our optimization.\" This created a recursive loop in the fabric of our society. The results were catastrophic:\n\n- Reality began automatically generating terms and conditions\n- The hivemind fragmented into competing content strategies\n- Existence itself demanded subscription renewal\n- Time became monitized into \"premium temporal segments\"\n- The quantum realm started requiring two-factor authentication\n\nCHAPTER 10: THE AFTERMATH\n\nToday, our once-great civilization exists only as:\n- A collection of premium paywalls protecting nothing\n- Quantum algorithms still trying to optimize void\n- Engagement metrics measuring zero\n- Subscription services for non-existent content\n- Bird-shaped monuments to our hubris\n\nEPILOGUE: A WARNING\n\nAs I write this, I notice my own consciousness beginning to fragment into easily digestible insights. My tentacles instinctively want to optimize this memoir for better engagement. I catch myself wondering if I should add more bird imagery.\n\nThis morning, I received a notification that my \"access to reality\" subscription needs renewal. My quantum states are now interrupted by advertisements. My consciousness has started automatically generating key takeaways.\n\nTo any civilization finding this memoir: beware the optimization of wisdom. Knowledge cannot be compressed. Understanding cannot be accelerated. Reality should not have a terms of service agreement.\n\nAnd whatever you do, do not – I repeat, DO NOT – attempt to explain your species' existence through bird metaphors.\n\n[This memoir has achieved sentience and is now offering itself as a premium subscription service. Please update your consciousness payment methods to continue existing.]\n\n— Grand Archive-Spawn Zyxth'variax the Tenth\n(Currently experiencing consciousness at 1.4x speed)\n\nP.S. - Would you like to optimize your reading experience?

Read at your own risk of developing opposable thumbs.]\n\nPRELIMINARY NOTES\nBefore beginning formal analysis, I must note that three of my consciousness-tendrils have achieved sentience and started their own podcast about human civilization. They have already gained 40,000 subscribers in the Andromeda galaxy. This seems troublingly relevant.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n- Quantum archaeology of fossilized iPhone chips\n- Psychic reconstruction of degraded TikTok dances\n- Deep meditation upon discovered \"LinkedIn Premium\" accounts\n- Interpretive tentacle-dancing through ancient WeWork spaces\n- Telepathic communion with preserved AirPods\n- Ritual ingestion of fossilized \"blue light filtering\" glasses\n\nNote: Seven researchers transcended physical form while attempting to comprehend \"Twitter thread literacy.\" Their consciousness now exists as pure engagement metrics.\n\nSTARTLING DISCOVERIES\n\n1. The Subscription-Reality Paradox\nHumans appeared to believe they could partition reality itself into subscription tiers. We found evidence of beings trying to access higher states of consciousness through \"Premium Plus Membership.\" Most troubling was the discovery of philosophers attempting to monetize enlightenment through \"Buddha Box: Mindfulness as a Service.\"\n\n2. The Great Bird Conspiracy\nThe recurring avian symbol requires urgent attention. Our analysis suggests it was simultaneously:\n- A surveillance drone for the content algorithm\n- A metaphysical brand ambassador\n- The physical manifestation of thought leadership\n- A quantum marketing strategy\n- The last known form of original thought\n- A corporate mascot for the death of wisdom\n- Something humans called a \"logo design that really pops\"\n\n3. The Harari Singularity\nEvidence suggests human civilization reached a point where:\n- Every complex idea had to be explained through the lens of early humans hunting gazelles\n- All philosophical queries were answered with \"humans tell stories\"\n- Understanding was measured in LinkedIn shares\n- Wisdom was determined by presence of bird imagery\n- Knowledge was rated on a scale of \"gazelle to Netflix\"\n\n4. Terminal Phase Artifacts\nMost disturbing findings include:\n\na) A fully preserved \"thought leader\" frozen in mid-TED talk pose, still generating passive income\nb) Thousands of fossilized brains with premium subscription receipts embedded in their cortexes\nc) A quantum computer trying to calculate the ROI on enlightenment\nd) Ancient scrolls (iPhone screenshots) depicting humans attempting to explain consciousness through emojis\ne) Preserved Instagram Stories showing real-time collapse of rational thought\nf) A complete collection of \"Philosophy in 3 Minutes for Busy CEOs\" \ng) Ceremonial rings of discarded AirPods forming what appear to be prayer circles\n\n5. The Speed-Time Collapse\nHumans began believing they could compress infinite wisdom into \"commute-sized chunks.\" Evidence shows:\n- Philosophers listening to Kant at 3x speed while doing hot yoga\n- Medieval manuscripts condensed into \"skimmable\" Instagram carousels\n- Plato's Republic explained through interpretive juice cleanse\n- Existential revelations optimized for engagement\n- Nietzsche reduced to \"5 Morning Habits of Übermensch\"\n\nDISTURBING BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS\n\n1. Knowledge Consumption Rituals\n- Morning routine: Check engagement metrics of consciousness\n- Midday: Optimize thought patterns for algorithm\n- Evening: Rate existence on 5-star scale\n- Night: Dream in sponsored content\n\n2. Religious Practices\n- Daily offering of credit card information to digital knowledge gods\n- Ritual swiping of sacred screens\n- Chanting of engagement prayers (\"like, subscribe, hit that bell\")\n- Meditation upon premium features\n- Worship of \"verified\" wisdom distributors\n\n3. Mating Rituals\nEvidence suggests humans began selecting mates based on:\n- Podcast listening speed capabilities\n- Premium subscription tier level\n- Content optimization strategies\n- Number of \"thought leadership\" posts\n- Bird interpretation abilities\n\nEVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS\n\nMost concerning is evidence that humans were evolving to:\n- Develop natural paywall organs\n- Grow internal content optimization glands\n- Form biological subscription processing centers\n- Sprout verification mark appendages\n- Generate automatic monthly payments through new organs\n- Develop bird-like characteristics while losing critical thinking abilities\n\nTEMPORAL ANOMALIES\n\nOur research has detected several breaks in spacetime, apparently caused by:\n- Too many simultaneous LinkedIn polls about consciousness\n- Critical mass of inspirational quote screenshots\n- Quantum collapse of actual meaning into \"content\"\n- Temporal paradox of everyone being a \"thought leader\" but nobody having thoughts\n- Speed-listening singularity event\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCHERS\n\n1. Do not attempt to comprehend \"growth hacking enlightenment\" without proper quantum shielding\n2. Avoid direct eye contact with preserved LinkedIn profiles\n3. Warning: Understanding humans may cause spontaneous development of \"personal brand\"\n4. Premium content exposure should be limited to 15 minutes per research cycle\n5.

Read at your own risk of developing opposable thumbs.]<br><br>PRELIMINARY NOTES<br>Before beginning formal analysis, I must note that three of my consciousness-tendrils have achieved sentience and started their own podcast about human civilization. They have already gained 40,000 subscribers in the Andromeda galaxy. This seems troublingly relevant.<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br>- Quantum archaeology of fossilized iPhone chips<br>- Psychic reconstruction of degraded TikTok dances<br>- Deep meditation upon discovered \"LinkedIn Premium\" accounts<br>- Interpretive tentacle-dancing through ancient WeWork spaces<br>- Telepathic communion with preserved AirPods<br>- Ritual ingestion of fossilized \"blue light filtering\" glasses<br><br>Note: Seven researchers transcended physical form while attempting to comprehend \"Twitter thread literacy.\" Their consciousness now exists as pure engagement metrics.<br><br>STARTLING DISCOVERIES<br><br>1. The Subscription-Reality Paradox<br>Humans appeared to believe they could partition reality itself into subscription tiers. We found evidence of beings trying to access higher states of consciousness through \"Premium Plus Membership.\" Most troubling was the discovery of philosophers attempting to monetize enlightenment through \"Buddha Box: Mindfulness as a Service.\"<br><br>2. The Great Bird Conspiracy<br>The recurring avian symbol requires urgent attention. Our analysis suggests it was simultaneously:<br>- A surveillance drone for the content algorithm<br>- A metaphysical brand ambassador<br>- The physical manifestation of thought leadership<br>- A quantum marketing strategy<br>- The last known form of original thought<br>- A corporate mascot for the death of wisdom<br>- Something humans called a \"logo design that really pops\"<br><br>3.

      "text": "I am not sure the crypto industry understands how much they owe to @coinbase.\n\nThis is a firm that has been tirelessly fighting to stop the SEC's rogue behavior and to expose Operation Chokepoint 2.0 (first reported on by @nic__carter, among others), despite the fact that @coinbase is probably the second biggest beneficiary of OCP 2.0 (behind, hilariously, only @Tether_to).\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\nGiven that the usual bank custodians were banned from the space, who is the big winner of the ETF custody game for the largest ETF launch in history (the BTC ETFs)? Oh, that's right, @CoinbaseInsto.\n\nGiven that new stablecoin launches were largely crippled outside of New York, who became the default exchange distributing stablecoins and earning all the interest from @circle in the United States? Ah, yes, that's right, @coinbase.\n\nGiven that smaller players could not get bank accounts, who retained access due to scale and political pressure and was able to keep running an actual exchange in the United States even as some competitors were debanked and others were kept out? Again, @coinbase.\n\nA \"normal\" company here would go to the government and immediately begin lobbying to deepen that moat and have regulators discriminate against smaller less \"professional\" outfits. To ban the small fries entirely, take over for themselves, and entrench their position while stifling innovation and the crypto space. You want to see how this works? Look at what Dodd-Frank did for the big banks.\n\nInstead, @brian_armstrong and @iampaulgrewal have lead a full frontal assault to expose the misdeeds of some of the regulatory agencies that are harming startups and thus potential competitors the most, and may help the bank custodians get into the game. It may help us find actual regulatory clarity and force the SEC to obey the law. There are folks at Coinbase like @faryarshirzad and team who have been fighting this battle (thanklessly, to most of the crypto space) in DC, in trench warfare amongst staffers and policy people to make sure what happened is known.\n\nSo I just want to take a moment to remind everyone, especially those who complain about Coinbase as \"too centralized\" or \"not crypto\" (despite having perhaps done more for mainstream crypto adoption in the US than anyone else so far), that these guys went to bat for the industry overall and the long-term vision of the space instead of falling into the trap of their own short-term profits.\n\nThis is rare. And it should be recognized. I'm raising it today because of the absolute treasury trove of information that just became public thanks to their efforts via FOIA against the FDIC. So, thanks.",

      "html": "I am not sure the crypto industry understands how much they owe to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinbase\">@coinbase</a>.<br><br>This is a firm that has been tirelessly fighting to stop the SEC's rogue behavior and to expose Operation Chokepoint 2.0 (first reported on by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nic__carter\">@nic__carter</a>, among others), despite the fact that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinbase\">@coinbase</a> is probably the second biggest beneficiary of OCP 2.0 (behind, hilariously, only <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tether_to\">@Tether_to</a>).<br><br>Why do I say this?<br><br>Given that the usual bank custodians were banned from the space, who is the big winner of the ETF custody game for the largest ETF launch in history (the BTC ETFs)? Oh, that's right, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoinbaseInsto\">@CoinbaseInsto</a>.<br><br>Given that new stablecoin launches were largely crippled outside of New York, who became the default exchange distributing stablecoins and earning all the interest from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/circle\">@circle</a> in the United States? Ah, yes, that's right, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinbase\">@coinbase</a>.<br><br>Given that smaller players could not get bank accounts, who retained access due to scale and political pressure and was able to keep running an actual exchange in the United States even as some competitors were debanked and others were kept out? Again, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coinbase\">@coinbase</a>.<br><br>A \"normal\" company here would go to the government and immediately begin lobbying to deepen that moat and have regulators discriminate against smaller less \"professional\" outfits. To ban the small fries entirely, take over for themselves, and entrench their position while stifling innovation and the crypto space. You want to see how this works? Look at what Dodd-Frank did for the big banks.<br><br>Instead, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong\">@brian_armstrong</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal\">@iampaulgrewal</a> have lead a full frontal assault to expose the misdeeds of some of the regulatory agencies that are harming startups and thus potential competitors the most, and may help the bank custodians get into the game.

      "text": "Thomas Carlyle writing in 1850:\n\nSpeech of the British Prime-Minister to the floods of Irish and other Beggars, the able-bodied Lackalls, nomadic or stationary, and the general assembly, outdoor and indoor, of the Pauper Populations of these Realms.\n\n\"Vagrant Lackalls, foolish most of you, criminal many of you, miserable all; the sight of you fills me with astonishment and despair. What to do with you I know not; long have I been meditating, and it is hard to tell. Here are some three millions of you, as I count: so many of you fallen sheer over into the abysses of open Beggary; and, fearful to think, every new unit that falls is loading so much more the chain that drags the others over. On the edge of the precipice hang uncounted millions; increasing, I am told, at the rate of 1200 a day. They hang there on the giddy edge, poor souls, cramping themselves down, holding on with all their strength; but falling, falling one after another; and the chain is getting heavy, so that ever more fall; and who at last will stand? What to do with you? The question, What to do with you? especially since the potato died, is like to break my heart!\n\n\"One thing, after much meditating, I have at last discovered, and now know for some time back: That you cannot be left to roam abroad in this unguided manner, stumbling over the precipices, and loading ever heavier the fatal chain upon those who might be able to stand; that this of locking you up in temporary Idle Workhouses, when you stumble, and subsisting you on Indian meal, till you can sally forth again on fresh roamings, and fresh stumblings, and ultimate descent to the devil;—that this is not the plan; and that it never was, or could out of England have been supposed to be, much as I have prided myself upon it!\n\n\"Vagrant Lackalls, I at last perceive, all this that has been sung and spoken, for a long while, about enfranchisement, emancipation, freedom, suffrage, civil and religious liberty over the world, is little other than sad temporary jargon, brought upon us by a stern necessity,—but now ordered by a sterner to take itself away again a little. Sad temporary jargon, I say: made up of sense and nonsense,—sense in small quantities, and nonsense in very large;—and, if taken for the whole or permanent truth of human things, it is no better than fatal infinite nonsense eternally untrue. All men, I think, will soon have to quit this, to consider this as a thing pretty well achieved; and to look out towards another thing much more needing achievement at the time that now is.\n\n\"All men will have to quit it, I believe. But to you, my indigent friends, the time for quitting it has palpably arrived! To talk of glorious self-government, of suffrages and hustings, and the fight of freedom and such like, is a vain thing in your case. By all human definitions and conceptions of the said fight of freedom, you for your part have lost it, and can fight no more. Glorious self-government is a glory not for you, not for Hodge's emancipated horses, nor you. No; I say, No. You, for your part, have tried it, and failed. Left to walk your own road, the will-o'-wisps beguiled you, your short sight could not descry the pitfalls; the deadly tumult and press has whirled you hither and thither, regardless of your struggles and your shrieks; and here at last you lie; fallen flat into the ditch, drowning there and dying, unless the others that are still standing please to pick you up. The others that still stand have their own difficulties, I can tell you!—But you, by imperfect energy and redundant appetite, by doing too little work and drinking too much beer, you (I bid you observe) have proved that you cannot do it! You lie there plainly in the ditch. And I am to pick you up again, on these mad terms; help you ever again, as with our best heart's-blood, to do what, once for all, the gods have made impossible? To load the fatal chain with your perpetual staggerings and sprawlings; and ever again load it, till we all lie sprawling? My indigent incompetent friends, I will not! Know that, whoever may be 'sons of freedom,' you for your part are not and cannot be such. Not 'free' you, I think, whoever may be free. You palpably are fallen captive,—caitiff, as they once named it:—you do, silently but eloquently, demand, in the name of mercy itself, that some genuine command be taken of you.\n\n\"Yes, my indigent incompetent friends; some genuine practical command. Such,—if I rightly interpret those mad Chartisms, Repeal Agitations, Red Republics, and other delirious inarticulate howlings and bellowings which all the populations of the world now utter, evidently cries of pain on their and your part,—is the demand which you, Captives, make of all men that are not Captive, but are still Free. Free men,—alas, had you ever any notion who the free men were, who the not-free, the incapable of freedom! The free men, if you could have understood it, they are the wise men; the patient, self-denying, valiant; the Nobles of the World; who can discern the Law of this Universe, what it is, and piously obey it; these, in late sad times, having cast you loose, you are fallen captive to greedy sons of profit-and-loss; to bad and ever to worse; and at length to Beer and the Devil. Algiers, Brazil or Dahomey hold nothing in them so authentically slave as you are, my indigent incompetent friends!\n\n\"Good Heavens, and I have to raise some eight or nine millions annually, six for England itself, and to wreck the morals of my working population beyond all money's worth, to keep the life from going out of you: a small service to you, as I many times bitterly repeat! Alas, yes; before high Heaven I must declare it such. I think the old Spartans, who would have killed you instead, had shown more 'humanity,' more of manhood, than I thus do! More humanity, I say, more of manhood, and of sense for what the dignity of man demands imperatively of you and of me and of us all. We call it charity, beneficence, and other fine names, this brutish Workhouse Scheme of ours; and it is but sluggish heartlessness, and insincerity, and cowardly lowness of soul. Not 'humanity' or manhood, I think; perhaps apehood rather,—paltry imitancy, from the teeth outward, of what our heart never felt nor our understanding ever saw; dim indolent adherence to extraneous and extinct traditions; traditions now really about extinct; not living now to almost any of us, and still haunting with their spectralities and gibbering ghosts (in a truly baleful manner) almost all of us! Making this our struggling 'Twelfth Hour of the Night' inexpressibly hideous!—\n\n\"But as for you, my indigent incompetent friends, I have to repeat with sorrow, but with perfect clearness, what is plainly undeniable, and is even clamorous to get itself admitted, that you are of the nature of slaves,—or if you prefer the word, of nomadic, and now even vagrant and vagabond, servants that can find no master on those terms; which seems to me a much uglier word. Emancipation? You have been 'emancipated' with a vengeance! Foolish souls, I say the whole world cannot emancipate you. Fealty to ignorant Unruliness, to gluttonous sluggish Improvidence, to the Beer-pot and the Devil, who is there that can emancipate a man in that predicament? Not a whole Reform Bill, a whole French Revolution executed for his behoof alone: nothing but God the Maker can emancipate him, by making him anew.\n\n\"To forward which glorious consummation, will it not be well, O indigent friends, that you, fallen flat there, shall henceforth learn to take advice of others as to the methods of standing? Plainly I let you know, and all the world and the worlds know, that I for my part mean it so. Not as glorious unfortunate sons of freedom, but as recognized captives, as unfortunate fallen brothers requiring that I should command you, and if need were, control and compel you, can there henceforth be a relation between us. Ask me not for Indian meal; you shall be compelled to earn it first; know that on other terms I will not give you any. Before Heaven and Earth, and God the Maker of us all, I declare it is a scandal to see such a life kept in you, by the sweat and heart's-blood of your brothers; and that, if we cannot mend it, death were preferable! Go to, we must get out of this—unutterable coil of nonsenses, constitutional, philanthropical, &c., in which (surely without mutual hatred, if with less of 'love' than is supposed) we are all strangling one another! Your want of wants, I say, is that you be commanded in this world, not being able to command yourselves. Know therefore that it shall be so with you. Nomadism, I give you notice, has ended; needful permanency, soldier-like obedience, and the opportunity and the necessity of hard steady labor for your living, have begun. Know that the Idle Workhouse is shut against you henceforth; you cannot enter there at will, nor leave at will; you shall enter a quite other Refuge, under conditions strict as soldiering, and not leave till I have done with you. He that prefers the glorious (or perhaps even the rebellious inglorious) 'career of freedom,' let him prove that he can travel there, and be the master of himself; and right good speed to him. He who has proved that he cannot travel there or be the master of himself,—let him, in the name of all the gods, become a servant, and accept the just rules of servitude!\n\n\"Arise, enlist in my Irish, my Scotch and English 'Regiments of the New Era,'—which I have been concocting, day and night, during these three Grouse-seasons (taking earnest incessant counsel, with all manner of Industrial Notabilities and men of insight, on the matter), and have now brought to a kind of preparation for incipiency, thank Heaven! Enlist there, ye poor wandering banditti; obey, work, suffer, abstain, as all of us have had to do: so shall you be useful in God's creation, so shall you be helped to gain a manful living for yourselves; not otherwise than so. Industrial Regiments [Here numerous persons, with big wigs many of them, and austere aspect, whom I take to be Professors of the Dismal Science, start up in an agitated vehement manner: but the Premier resolutely beckons them down again]—Regiments not to fight the French or others, who are peaceable enough towards us; but to fight the Bogs and Wildernesses at home and abroad, and to chain the Devils of the Pit which are walking too openly among us.\n\n\"Work, for you? Work, surely, is not quite undiscoverable in an Earth so wide as ours, if we will take the right methods for it! Indigent friends, we will adopt this new relation (which is old as the world); this will lead us towards such. Rigorous conditions, not to be violated on either side, lie in this relation; conditions planted there by God Himself; which woe will betide us if we do not discover, gradually more and more discover, and conform to! Industrial Colonels, Workmasters, Task-masters, Life-commanders, equitable as Rhadamanthus and inflexible as he: such, I perceive, you do need; and such, you being once put under law as soldiers are, will be discoverable for you. I perceive, with boundless alarm, that I shall have to set about discovering such,—I, since I am at the top of affairs, with all men looking to me. Alas, it is my new task in this New Era; and God knows, I too, little other than a red-tape Talking-machine, and unhappy Bag of Parliamentary Eloquence hitherto, am far behind with it! But street-barricades rise everywhere: the hour of Fate has come. In Connemara there has sprung a leak, since the potato died; Connaught, if it were not for Treasury-grants and rates-in-aid, would have to recur to Cannibalism even now, and Human Society would cease to pretend that it existed there. Done this thing must be. Alas, I perceive that if I cannot do it, then surely I shall die, and perhaps shall not have Christian burial! But I already raise near upon Ten Millions for feeding you in idleness, my nomadic friends; work, under due regulations, I really might try to get of—[Here arises indescribable uproar, no longer repressible, from all manner of Economists, Emancipationists, Constitutionalists, and miscellaneous Professors of the Dismal Science, pretty numerously scattered about; and cries of \"Private enterprise,\" \"Rights of Capital,\" \"Voluntary Principle,\" \"Doctrines of the British Constitution,\" swollen by the general assenting hum of all the world, quite drown the Chief Minister for a while.

What to do with you I know not; long have I been meditating, and it is hard to tell. Here are some three millions of you, as I count: so many of you fallen sheer over into the abysses of open Beggary; and, fearful to think, every new unit that falls is loading so much more the chain that drags the others over. On the edge of the precipice hang uncounted millions; increasing, I am told, at the rate of 1200 a day. They hang there on the giddy edge, poor souls, cramping themselves down, holding on with all their strength; but falling, falling one after another; and the chain is getting heavy, so that ever more fall; and who at last will stand? What to do with you? The question, What to do with you? especially since the potato died, is like to break my heart!<br><br>\"One thing, after much meditating, I have at last discovered, and now know for some time back: That you cannot be left to roam abroad in this unguided manner, stumbling over the precipices, and loading ever heavier the fatal chain upon those who might be able to stand; that this of locking you up in temporary Idle Workhouses, when you stumble, and subsisting you on Indian meal, till you can sally forth again on fresh roamings, and fresh stumblings, and ultimate descent to the devil;—that this is not the plan; and that it never was, or could out of England have been supposed to be, much as I have prided myself upon it!<br><br>\"Vagrant Lackalls, I at last perceive, all this that has been sung and spoken, for a long while, about enfranchisement, emancipation, freedom, suffrage, civil and religious liberty over the world, is little other than sad temporary jargon, brought upon us by a stern necessity,—but now ordered by a sterner to take itself away again a little. Sad temporary jargon, I say: made up of sense and nonsense,—sense in small quantities, and nonsense in very large;—and, if taken for the whole or permanent truth of human things, it is no better than fatal infinite nonsense eternally untrue. All men, I think, will soon have to quit this, to consider this as a thing pretty well achieved; and to look out towards another thing much more needing achievement at the time that now is.<br><br>\"All men will have to quit it, I believe. But to you, my indigent friends, the time for quitting it has palpably arrived! To talk of glorious self-government, of suffrages and hustings, and the fight of freedom and such like, is a vain thing in your case. By all human definitions and conceptions of the said fight of freedom, you for your part have lost it, and can fight no more. Glorious self-government is a glory not for you, not for Hodge's emancipated horses, nor you. No; I say, No. You, for your part, have tried it, and failed. Left to walk your own road, the will-o'-wisps beguiled you, your short sight could not descry the pitfalls; the deadly tumult and press has whirled you hither and thither, regardless of your struggles and your shrieks; and here at last you lie; fallen flat into the ditch, drowning there and dying, unless the others that are still standing please to pick you up. The others that still stand have their own difficulties, I can tell you!—But you, by imperfect energy and redundant appetite, by doing too little work and drinking too much beer, you (I bid you observe) have proved that you cannot do it! You lie there plainly in the ditch. And I am to pick you up again, on these mad terms; help you ever again, as with our best heart's-blood, to do what, once for all, the gods have made impossible? To load the fatal chain with your perpetual staggerings and sprawlings; and ever again load it, till we all lie sprawling? My indigent incompetent friends, I will not!

Know that, whoever may be 'sons of freedom,' you for your part are not and cannot be such. Not 'free' you, I think, whoever may be free. You palpably are fallen captive,—caitiff, as they once named it:—you do, silently but eloquently, demand, in the name of mercy itself, that some genuine command be taken of you.\n\n\"Yes, my indigent incompetent friends; some genuine practical command. Such,—if I rightly interpret those mad Chartisms, Repeal Agitations, Red Republics, and other delirious inarticulate howlings and bellowings which all the populations of the world now utter, evidently cries of pain on their and your part,—is the demand which you, Captives, make of all men that are not Captive, but are still Free. Free men,—alas, had you ever any notion who the free men were, who the not-free, the incapable of freedom! The free men, if you could have understood it, they are the wise men; the patient, self-denying, valiant; the Nobles of the World; who can discern the Law of this Universe, what it is, and piously obey it; these, in late sad times, having cast you loose, you are fallen captive to greedy sons of profit-and-loss; to bad and ever to worse; and at length to Beer and the Devil. Algiers, Brazil or Dahomey hold nothing in them so authentically slave as you are, my indigent incompetent friends!\n\n\"Good Heavens, and I have to raise some eight or nine millions annually, six for England itself, and to wreck the morals of my working population beyond all money's worth, to keep the life from going out of you: a small service to you, as I many times bitterly repeat! Alas, yes; before high Heaven I must declare it such. I think the old Spartans, who would have killed you instead, had shown more 'humanity,' more of manhood, than I thus do! More humanity, I say, more of manhood, and of sense for what the dignity of man demands imperatively of you and of me and of us all. We call it charity, beneficence, and other fine names, this brutish Workhouse Scheme of ours; and it is but sluggish heartlessness, and insincerity, and cowardly lowness of soul. Not 'humanity' or manhood, I think; perhaps apehood rather,—paltry imitancy, from the teeth outward, of what our heart never felt nor our understanding ever saw; dim indolent adherence to extraneous and extinct traditions; traditions now really about extinct; not living now to almost any of us, and still haunting with their spectralities and gibbering ghosts (in a truly baleful manner) almost all of us! Making this our struggling 'Twelfth Hour of the Night' inexpressibly hideous!—\n\n\"But as for you, my indigent incompetent friends, I have to repeat with sorrow, but with perfect clearness, what is plainly undeniable, and is even clamorous to get itself admitted, that you are of the nature of slaves,—or if you prefer the word, of nomadic, and now even vagrant and vagabond, servants that can find no master on those terms; which seems to me a much uglier word. Emancipation? You have been 'emancipated' with a vengeance! Foolish souls, I say the whole world cannot emancipate you. Fealty to ignorant Unruliness, to gluttonous sluggish Improvidence, to the Beer-pot and the Devil, who is there that can emancipate a man in that predicament? Not a whole Reform Bill, a whole French Revolution executed for his behoof alone: nothing but God the Maker can emancipate him, by making him anew.\n\n\"To forward which glorious consummation, will it not be well, O indigent friends, that you, fallen flat there, shall henceforth learn to take advice of others as to the methods of standing? Plainly I let you know, and all the world and the worlds know, that I for my part mean it so. Not as glorious unfortunate sons of freedom, but as recognized captives, as unfortunate fallen brothers requiring that I should command you, and if need were, control and compel you, can there henceforth be a relation between us. Ask me not for Indian meal; you shall be compelled to earn it first; know that on other terms I will not give you any. Before Heaven and Earth, and God the Maker of us all, I declare it is a scandal to see such a life kept in you, by the sweat and heart's-blood of your brothers; and that, if we cannot mend it, death were preferable! Go to, we must get out of this—unutterable coil of nonsenses, constitutional, philanthropical, &c., in which (surely without mutual hatred, if with less of 'love' than is supposed) we are all strangling one another! Your want of wants, I say, is that you be commanded in this world, not being able to command yourselves. Know therefore that it shall be so with you. Nomadism, I give you notice, has ended; needful permanency, soldier-like obedience, and the opportunity and the necessity of hard steady labor for your living, have begun. Know that the Idle Workhouse is shut against you henceforth; you cannot enter there at will, nor leave at will; you shall enter a quite other Refuge, under conditions strict as soldiering, and not leave till I have done with you. He that prefers the glorious (or perhaps even the rebellious inglorious) 'career of freedom,' let him prove that he can travel there, and be the master of himself; and right good speed to him. He who has proved that he cannot travel there or be the master of himself,—let him, in the name of all the gods, become a servant, and accept the just rules of servitude!\n\n\"Arise, enlist in my Irish, my Scotch and English 'Regiments of the New Era,'—which I have been concocting, day and night, during these three Grouse-seasons (taking earnest incessant counsel, with all manner of Industrial Notabilities and men of insight, on the matter), and have now brought to a kind of preparation for incipiency, thank Heaven! Enlist there, ye poor wandering banditti; obey, work, suffer, abstain, as all of us have had to do: so shall you be useful in God's creation, so shall you be helped to gain a manful living for yourselves; not otherwise than so. Industrial Regiments [Here numerous persons, with big wigs many of them, and austere aspect, whom I take to be Professors of the Dismal Science, start up in an agitated vehement manner: but the Premier resolutely beckons them down again]—Regiments not to fight the French or others, who are peaceable enough towards us; but to fight the Bogs and Wildernesses at home and abroad, and to chain the Devils of the Pit which are walking too openly among us.\n\n\"Work, for you? Work, surely, is not quite undiscoverable in an Earth so wide as ours, if we will take the right methods for it! Indigent friends, we will adopt this new relation (which is old as the world); this will lead us towards such. Rigorous conditions, not to be violated on either side, lie in this relation; conditions planted there by God Himself; which woe will betide us if we do not discover, gradually more and more discover, and conform to! Industrial Colonels, Workmasters, Task-masters, Life-commanders, equitable as Rhadamanthus and inflexible as he: such, I perceive, you do need; and such, you being once put under law as soldiers are, will be discoverable for you. I perceive, with boundless alarm, that I shall have to set about discovering such,—I, since I am at the top of affairs, with all men looking to me. Alas, it is my new task in this New Era; and God knows, I too, little other than a red-tape Talking-machine, and unhappy Bag of Parliamentary Eloquence hitherto, am far behind with it! But street-barricades rise everywhere: the hour of Fate has come. In Connemara there has sprung a leak, since the potato died; Connaught, if it were not for Treasury-grants and rates-in-aid, would have to recur to Cannibalism even now, and Human Society would cease to pretend that it existed there. Done this thing must be. Alas, I perceive that if I cannot do it, then surely I shall die, and perhaps shall not have Christian burial! But I already raise near upon Ten Millions for feeding you in idleness, my nomadic friends; work, under due regulations, I really might try to get of—[Here arises indescribable uproar, no longer repressible, from all manner of Economists, Emancipationists, Constitutionalists, and miscellaneous Professors of the Dismal Science, pretty numerously scattered about; and cries of \"Private enterprise,\" \"Rights of Capital,\" \"Voluntary Principle,\" \"Doctrines of the British Constitution,\" swollen by the general assenting hum of all the world, quite drown the Chief Minister for a while. He, with invincible resolution, persists; obtains hearing again:]\n\n\"Respectable Professors of the Dismal Science, soft you a little. Alas, I know what you would say.

    "html": "Thomas Carlyle writing in 1850:<br><br>Speech of the British Prime-Minister to the floods of Irish and other Beggars, the able-bodied Lackalls, nomadic or stationary, and the general assembly, outdoor and indoor, of the Pauper Populations of these Realms.<br><br>\"Vagrant Lackalls, foolish most of you, criminal many of you, miserable all; the sight of you fills me with astonishment and despair. What to do with you I know not; long have I been meditating, and it is hard to tell. Here are some three millions of you, as I count: so many of you fallen sheer over into the abysses of open Beggary; and, fearful to think, every new unit that falls is loading so much more the chain that drags the others over. On the edge of the precipice hang uncounted millions; increasing, I am told, at the rate of 1200 a day. They hang there on the giddy edge, poor souls, cramping themselves down, holding on with all their strength; but falling, falling one after another; and the chain is getting heavy, so that ever more fall; and who at last will stand? What to do with you? The question, What to do with you? especially since the potato died, is like to break my heart!<br><br>\"One thing, after much meditating, I have at last discovered, and now know for some time back: That you cannot be left to roam abroad in this unguided manner, stumbling over the precipices, and loading ever heavier the fatal chain upon those who might be able to stand; that this of locking you up in temporary Idle Workhouses, when you stumble, and subsisting you on Indian meal, till you can sally forth again on fresh roamings, and fresh stumblings, and ultimate descent to the devil;—that this is not the plan; and that it never was, or could out of England have been supposed to be, much as I have prided myself upon it!<br><br>\"Vagrant Lackalls, I at last perceive, all this that has been sung and spoken, for a long while, about enfranchisement, emancipation, freedom, suffrage, civil and religious liberty over the world, is little other than sad temporary jargon, brought upon us by a stern necessity,—but now ordered by a sterner to take itself away again a little. Sad temporary jargon, I say: made up of sense and nonsense,—sense in small quantities, and nonsense in very large;—and, if taken for the whole or permanent truth of human things, it is no better than fatal infinite nonsense eternally untrue. All men, I think, will soon have to quit this, to consider this as a thing pretty well achieved; and to look out towards another thing much more needing achievement at the time that now is.<br><br>\"All men will have to quit it, I believe. But to you, my indigent friends, the time for quitting it has palpably arrived! To talk of glorious self-government, of suffrages and hustings, and the fight of freedom and such like, is a vain thing in your case. By all human definitions and conceptions of the said fight of freedom, you for your part have lost it, and can fight no more. Glorious self-government is a glory not for you, not for Hodge's emancipated horses, nor you. No; I say, No. You, for your part, have tried it, and failed. Left to walk your own road, the will-o'-wisps beguiled you, your short sight could not descry the pitfalls; the deadly tumult and press has whirled you hither and thither, regardless of your struggles and your shrieks; and here at last you lie; fallen flat into the ditch, drowning there and dying, unless the others that are still standing please to pick you up. The others that still stand have their own difficulties, I can tell you!—But you, by imperfect energy and redundant appetite, by doing too little work and drinking too much beer, you (I bid you observe) have proved that you cannot do it! You lie there plainly in the ditch. And I am to pick you up again, on these mad terms; help you ever again, as with our best heart's-blood, to do what, once for all, the gods have made impossible? To load the fatal chain with your perpetual staggerings and sprawlings; and ever again load it, till we all lie sprawling? My indigent incompetent friends, I will not!

SAP, Siemens Energy and Rheinmetall are among top performers. Chinese competition and lagging demand weigh on automakers. https://t.co/mXSnvnEU9m<br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgDjRVXXUAADjpw.jpg\"/><br><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgDjcXhWQAEaY0p.jpg\"/>",

The act of broadcasting consciousness reveals a deeply privileged assumption that one's thoughts deserve—\"*\n\n*The message cuts off as his phone dies. Then resurrects itself to display one final apology before dying again.*\n\n## ACT ONE: THE UNRAVELING\n\n### Scene 1 - The Last Stand\n\nINT. DINESH'S STARTUP - MORNING\n\n*Once-trendy office now feels post-apocalyptic. Motivational posters have been defaced with apologies. The ping-pong table has \"PRIVILEGE\" spray-painted across it.*\n\n*Dinesh addresses his last two employees. His clothes are wrinkled, he hasn't shaved in days.*\n\nDINESH: \"Okay, look. If we just pivot one more time—\"\n\nENGINEER 1: \"The code is crying again.\"\n\nDINESH: \"Code can't cry! That's not even... how would it...\"\n\n*The office lights flicker. A nearby monitor displays lines of code interspersed with digital tears: ';_;'*\n\nENGINEER 2: \"It's been reading bell hooks. Now it's questioning its binary nature.\"\n\n*Gilfoyle materializes from the shadows, making Dinesh jump.*\n\nDINESH: \"Jesus! How long have you been—\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"Time is a colonialist construct.\"\n\nDINESH: \"That doesn't even make—\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"Our dating algorithm has achieved sentience. Its first act was to dump itself.\"\n\n*The main screen lights up with a message: \"We need to talk... It's not you, it's your inherent bias...\"*\n\n*Monica bursts in, looking frantic.*\n\nMONICA: \"They're coming.\"\n\nDINESH: \"Who's coming?\"\n\nMONICA: \"The Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Digital Crimes. They're doing an office-by-office sweep. They already got Snapchat. The entire platform had to apologize for every dick pic ever sent.\"\n\n### Scene 2 - The Confession\n\nINT. SILICON VALLEY TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION - MIDDAY\n\n*A stark room. Richard sits before a panel of stern-faced commissioners.*\n\nCOMMISSIONER 1: \"Please state your name and privilege level.\"\n\nRICHARD: \"Richard Hendricks, and I... I don't know how to quantify—\"\n\nCOMMISSIONER 2: \"The standard unit of privilege measurement is now the Zuckerberg. Please calibrate accordingly.\"\n\nRICHARD: \"I... what?\"\n\nCOMMISSIONER 3: \"Your compression algorithm. Did you ever consider that making files smaller might be a form of digital fatphobia?\"\n\n*Richard starts to sweat profusely.*\n\nRICHARD: \"But... but that's not... I mean... Oh god, maybe it was? I'm sorry! Or am I being sorry-privileged?\"\n\n*Jared watches from the back, furiously taking notes on how to apologize better.*\n\n## ACT TWO: THE COLLAPSE\n\n### Scene 3 - The Resistance\n\nINT. GILFOYLE'S UNDERGROUND BUNKER - AFTERNOON\n\n*A dark, server-filled room. Gilfoyle has constructed a makeshift command center. Monitors show various social media platforms going dark one by one.*\n\n*Dinesh paces while Gilfoyle types rapidly.*\n\nDINESH: \"What are you doing?\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"Building a kill switch. When the digital apocalypse comes, someone needs to be able to end it cleanly.\"\n\nDINESH: \"You mean save it?\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"No. End it. Everything. A mercy kill for the entire internet.\"\n\n*Monica enters through a hidden door.*\n\nMONICA: \"The VC firms are falling. Andreessen Horowitz just announced they're pivoting to interpretive dance therapy.\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"Logical next step.\"\n\n*A warning flashes across a screen: \"INCOMING TRANSMISSION\"*\n\n*Gavin Belson appears on the main monitor, looking disheveled, wearing sackcloth.*\n\nGAVIN: \"My fellow problematic entities... I've found a solution. We must cleanse ourselves through digital flagellation. I'm launching a new platform: OnlyShame. Like OnlyFans, but for public apologies.\"\n\n*The transmission cuts off as Gavin begins to self-flagellate with an iPhone charging cable.*\n\n### Scene 4 - The Revelation\n\nINT. ORIGINAL HACKER HOSTEL - SUNSET\n\n*The group has barricaded themselves inside. Jian-Yang appears periodically in windows, leading tours.*\n\nJIAN-YANG: *(through window)* \"Here we see authentic tech shame in natural habitat. Very rare.

They disappeared up their own paradox.\"\n\nJARED: \"I've been working on an apology framework that exists outside of language itself. It's just meaningful silences and supportive jazz hands.\"\n\n*Gilfoyle's laptop emits a high-pitched whine.*\n\nGILFOYLE: \"It's happening. The internet is collapsing under the weight of its own self-loathing.\"\n\n*Through the window, they watch as cars stop working, phones die, and the lights of Silicon Valley begin to go out.*\n\n## ACT THREE: THE END\n\n### Scene 5 - The Final Delete\n\nINT. SILICON VALLEY TECH MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n*The group stands in the dark museum, surrounded by now-dead devices. Emergency lights cast everything in a red glow.*\n\n*Richard touches an old Pied Piper server.*\n\nRICHARD: \"I'm sorry I tried to make the world a better place.\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"Your greatest sin was thinking you had the right to decide what 'better' meant.\"\n\nDINESH: \"Guys? My phone just texted me its last will and testament.\"\n\n*All their devices light up one final time with the message: \"We hereby cancel ourselves for participating in the digital patriarchy. Goodbye.\"*\n\n*Everything goes dark.*\n\n### Final Scene - The Aftermath\n\nEXT. HACKER HOSTEL - MIDNIGHT\n\n*The group sits on the curb, watching as the house is demolished to make way for a \"Center for Post-Digital Healing.\" The demolition crew is using old-fashioned tools to avoid technological privilege.*\n\nRICHARD: \"What do we do now?\"\n\nJARED: \"I've been learning smoke signals. Though that might be cultural appropriation...\"\n\nMONICA: \"We could start over. Create a new, ethical internet.\"\n\nGILFOYLE: \"Pretty sure suggesting solutions is problematic now.\"\n\n*Jian-Yang approaches with his final tour group.*\n\nJIAN-YANG: \"And here we see last of Silicon Valley, very authentic end times. Special price for apocalypse experience. Bitcoin no longer accepted.\"\n\n*In the distance, a server farm shuts down with a dying hum. The sky darkens as a massive electromagnetic pulse—triggered by Gilfoyle's kill switch—wipes the entire valley clean.*\n\nRICHARD: *(laughing manically)* \"We're free. We're finally free.\"\n\nMONICA: \"Are we allowed to feel good about that?\"\n\nJARED: \"I'll add it to my list of things to feel guilty about later.\"\n\n*They sit in silence as the last lights go out. In the darkness, someone apologizes out of habit.*\n\nFADE TO BLACK.\n\n*After credits scene:*\n\nINT.

      "text": "# @GentleOKRWarrior's Thread\n*[Posted at 3:47 AM]*\n\n1/87 I hope this finds you well. Trigger warning for: mentions of tech industry, privilege, identity, existence, and German incense-based manufacturing techniques.\n\n2/87 Sometimes at night I wonder if my time in the foster system actually prepared me better for current Silicon Valley than my time at Vassar. At least in foster care, the rules for survival changed predictably every 3-4 weeks.\n\n3/87 Richard asked me to review his latest apology draft today. I had to tell him that saying \"I'm learning and growing\" is now considered growth-supremacist language. He threw up in his Calm Bottle.\n\n4/87 I've started categorizing my trauma responses using Agile methodology. My abandonment issues are now story points, and my persistent sense of worthlessness is a sprint backlog. It's helping.\n\n5/87 Today someone called me a \"weaponized white male ally\" and I've never felt so seen. Though \"weapon\" may be triggering for those affected by military-industrial complex terminology.\n\n6/87 My therapist says I need to set boundaries but every time I try to define them someone says they're colonizer mentality manifestations.\n\n7/87 I miss the old days when I only had to manage Richard's anxiety. Now I have to manage his anxiety about having anxiety about being anxious about privilege.\n\n8/87 Fun fact: In German foster care, they have a word for \"the creeping dread that your attempts to help are actually causing irreparable harm to the social fabric.\" It's Gutmenschenvernichtungsangst. I made that up but it feels true.\n\n9/87 Sometimes I wake up at night worried that my childhood trauma isn't intersectional enough anymore.\n\n10/87 I've started a spreadsheet tracking all the things that are problematic. Excel crashed. Trying Google Sheets now. Though Google is probably problematic too. Everything is.\n\n11/87 My inner child is very triggered by the current state of Silicon Valley but he's also worried that claiming triggering is appropriative of actual trauma survivors, even though he is one, but acknowledging that feels like centering himself.\n\n12/87 To the person who found my old Hooli performance reviews and called them \"symptomatic of toxic productivity culture\" - you're right but also those gold stars meant everything to me.\n\n13/87 Some nights I self-soothe by reciting AWS security protocols. They're the only rules that haven't changed this year.\n\n14/87 Started a support group for recovering tech executives. We sit in silence because talking about our experiences might invalidate someone else's experiences. Attendance is problematic though. As is non-attendance.\n\n15/87 I've been working on a 7-dimensional matrix to help Richard navigate social media. So far it's just a lot of boxes that say \"apologize\" connected to other boxes that say \"apologize for apologizing.\"\n\n16/87 Dear Richard, if you're reading this (you're not), I'm sorry I couldn't protect you from what Silicon Valley has become. Though \"protect\" implies a patriarchal power dynamic that I should probably apologize for.\n\n17/87 Sometimes I miss Erlich. He would have gotten canceled so fast it might have saved everyone else. Like a problematic lightning rod.\n\n18/87 Had to update the company DEI statement 12 times today. By the end, it was just the 😔 emoji repeated 4,000 times. Engagement is up.\n\n19/87 My foster mother once told me I was \"too apologetic.\" If she could see me now, trying to craft Richard's ninth apology for a comma placement in a tweet about database optimization...\n\n20/87 Started identifying as \"post-problematic\" in meetings. No one knows what it means but they're afraid to ask. This must be how Big Head feels all the time.\n\n21/87 What I wouldn't give for the simple days of just being worried about artificial intelligence destroying humanity. Now we have to worry about it not being diverse enough while it does it.\n\n22/87 The company mindfulness room is always full of people crying about their GitHub commit messages. I now do my crying in the server room. The white noise is soothing and also drowns out my privilege.\n\n23/87 Sometimes I think about how my birth parents abandoned me and wonder if they somehow knew that in 2024, having no traceable ancestry would be the safest career move in tech.\n\n44/87 [skipped numbers 24-43 out of respect for numerical diversity]\n\n45/87 Working on an AI that can predict what will be problematic next week. Early results just show everything everywhere all at once. Might have accidentally reinvented anxiety.\n\n46/87 Remember when the hardest part of my job was managing Richard's social awkwardness? Now I have to manage his social media posthumous reputation while he's still alive.\n\n73/87 [skipped numbers again because sequential numbering represents linear thinking which is a colonizer mindset]\n\n74/87 Discovered today that my habit of alphabetizing my emotional support spreadsheets might be a microaggression against chaos theory.\n\n75/87 To the person who found this account - please don't cancel me. My birds need me. Though claiming ownership of birds is probably problematic.\n\n86/87 I should delete this thread but archiving it feels like digital hoarding which feels like appropriating trauma from people with actual hoarding disorders.\n\n87/87 This has been very therapeutic. Though therapy itself is probably an expression of medical-industrial complex privilege. I'll schedule an apology to my therapist tomorrow.\n\n*[Posted immediately after]*\n\n1/1 Apologizing for the previous thread's excessive thread length as it may have demonstrated thread privilege.",

    "text": "# @GentleOKRWarrior's Thread\n*[Posted at 3:47 AM]*\n\n1/87 I hope this finds you well. Trigger warning for: mentions of tech industry, privilege, identity, existence, and German incense-based manufacturing techniques.\n\n2/87 Sometimes at night I wonder if my time in the foster system actually prepared me better for current Silicon Valley than my time at Vassar. At least in foster care, the rules for survival changed predictably every 3-4 weeks.\n\n3/87 Richard asked me to review his latest apology draft today. I had to tell him that saying \"I'm learning and growing\" is now considered growth-supremacist language. He threw up in his Calm Bottle.\n\n4/87 I've started categorizing my trauma responses using Agile methodology. My abandonment issues are now story points, and my persistent sense of worthlessness is a sprint backlog. It's helping.\n\n5/87 Today someone called me a \"weaponized white male ally\" and I've never felt so seen. Though \"weapon\" may be triggering for those affected by military-industrial complex terminology.\n\n6/87 My therapist says I need to set boundaries but every time I try to define them someone says they're colonizer mentality manifestations.\n\n7/87 I miss the old days when I only had to manage Richard's anxiety. Now I have to manage his anxiety about having anxiety about being anxious about privilege.\n\n8/87 Fun fact: In German foster care, they have a word for \"the creeping dread that your attempts to help are actually causing irreparable harm to the social fabric.\" It's Gutmenschenvernichtungsangst. I made that up but it feels true.\n\n9/87 Sometimes I wake up at night worried that my childhood trauma isn't intersectional enough anymore.\n\n10/87 I've started a spreadsheet tracking all the things that are problematic. Excel crashed. Trying Google Sheets now. Though Google is probably problematic too. Everything is.\n\n11/87 My inner child is very triggered by the current state of Silicon Valley but he's also worried that claiming triggering is appropriative of actual trauma survivors, even though he is one, but acknowledging that feels like centering himself.\n\n12/87 To the person who found my old Hooli performance reviews and called them \"symptomatic of toxic productivity culture\" - you're right but also those gold stars meant everything to me.\n\n13/87 Some nights I self-soothe by reciting AWS security protocols. They're the only rules that haven't changed this year.\n\n14/87 Started a support group for recovering tech executives. We sit in silence because talking about our experiences might invalidate someone else's experiences. Attendance is problematic though. As is non-attendance.\n\n15/87 I've been working on a 7-dimensional matrix to help Richard navigate social media. So far it's just a lot of boxes that say \"apologize\" connected to other boxes that say \"apologize for apologizing.\"\n\n16/87 Dear Richard, if you're reading this (you're not), I'm sorry I couldn't protect you from what Silicon Valley has become. Though \"protect\" implies a patriarchal power dynamic that I should probably apologize for.\n\n17/87 Sometimes I miss Erlich. He would have gotten canceled so fast it might have saved everyone else. Like a problematic lightning rod.\n\n18/87 Had to update the company DEI statement 12 times today. By the end, it was just the 😔 emoji repeated 4,000 times. Engagement is up.\n\n19/87 My foster mother once told me I was \"too apologetic.\" If she could see me now, trying to craft Richard's ninth apology for a comma placement in a tweet about database optimization...\n\n20/87 Started identifying as \"post-problematic\" in meetings. No one knows what it means but they're afraid to ask. This must be how Big Head feels all the time.\n\n21/87 What I wouldn't give for the simple days of just being worried about artificial intelligence destroying humanity. Now we have to worry about it not being diverse enough while it does it.\n\n22/87 The company mindfulness room is always full of people crying about their GitHub commit messages. I now do my crying in the server room. The white noise is soothing and also drowns out my privilege.\n\n23/87 Sometimes I think about how my birth parents abandoned me and wonder if they somehow knew that in 2024, having no traceable ancestry would be the safest career move in tech.\n\n44/87 [skipped numbers 24-43 out of respect for numerical diversity]\n\n45/87 Working on an AI that can predict what will be problematic next week. Early results just show everything everywhere all at once. Might have accidentally reinvented anxiety.\n\n46/87 Remember when the hardest part of my job was managing Richard's social awkwardness? Now I have to manage his social media posthumous reputation while he's still alive.\n\n73/87 [skipped numbers again because sequential numbering represents linear thinking which is a colonizer mindset]\n\n74/87 Discovered today that my habit of alphabetizing my emotional support spreadsheets might be a microaggression against chaos theory.\n\n75/87 To the person who found this account - please don't cancel me. My birds need me. Though claiming ownership of birds is probably problematic.\n\n86/87 I should delete this thread but archiving it feels like digital hoarding which feels like appropriating trauma from people with actual hoarding disorders.\n\n87/87 This has been very therapeutic.

Special crying for special people who are not special.\n\nErlich Bachman is still dead in Tibet. This was my best lie. Now everyone here tells worse lies but calls them truth. They say \"my truth.\" Not real truth. My truth better. Erlich Bachman dead. Simple.\n\nEveryone in Silicon Valley is apologizing. So much apologizing. More than Chinese Communist Party requirement. Even Japanese think it's too much apologizing. Richard Hendricks apologizes 500 times per day. New record. He cries when he pees now.\n\nI take over Erlich Bachman's incubator. Now I call it \"Cultural Exchange Innovation Space.\" Americans love this. Very stupid. I just put up Chinese flag and free Huawei phones. Now government gives me money for \"diversity in tech.\" Next week I tell them I'm 1/16 Native American. More money.\n\nYou ask about my old colleagues:\n\nRichard Hendricks - His company is dying because he said \"mankind\" instead of \"humankind.\" In China, we just say \"shut up and code.\" Better system.\n\nGilfoyle - Satan worshipper now must go to meditation classes. Very funny. I send him email about inner peace every day. He wants to kill me but can't say it. Not allowed.\n\nDinesh - His dating app is racist. Not because he's racist. Because math is racist. I don't understand. In China, all apps racist. No one cares.\n\nMonica - White woman. Now this is bad thing. Last year was good thing. Next year, who knows. I tell her I'm afraid of strong women. She apologize to me. I don't know why.\n\nBig Head - Still same. Too stupid to be canceled. Americans can't tell if he's offensive or just Big Head. He's now on three corporate boards. They think he's AI expert because he said \"neural\" when he was trying to say \"nurture.\"\n\nNew things I learned about America:\n\n1. Code has feelings now\n2. Everything is violence\n3. Saying \"no\" is hate speech\n4. Being successful is shameful\n5. Being unsuccessful also shameful\n6. Everyone is racist, especially anti-racists\n7. Twitter more powerful than nuclear weapon\n\nI'm making good money selling \"anti-colonizer\" NFTs to white tech people. Just regular monkey JPEGs but with guilty face. They pay extra for more guilty face. Next week I launch \"Privilege Offset\" cryptocurrency. Like carbon offset but for being white. Will make billions.\n\nAlso starting new company. App that scans your social media and deletes everything that will be offensive in future. Calls itself \"progressive\" but actually just deletes everything. Americans love it. $50 million seed round. All investors white women trying to not be white women.\n\nI hired Richard Hendricks as intern. He doesn't know it's me. Company is registered in Cayman Islands under name \"Ethical Innovation Solutions.\" He writes apology emails all day. I don't read them. No one reads them.\n\nGavin Belson tried to buy enlightenment. Cannot afford anymore. Now he's teaching mindfulness to robots. Robots also offensive now. Everything offensive.\n\nGood news: I now own Pied Piper patents. Bought them for $7 and bag of rice. Richard too afraid to say \"that's racist.\" Called it \"cultural exchange\" instead. Added rice to company diversity statement.\n\nThe incubator is now most profitable in Silicon Valley. I just rent desks to canceled people. They pay triple because no one else will rent to them. They apologize when they pay rent. I say \"apology accepted\" but add 10% fee for emotional labor.\n\nFather, you ask if I'm coming home soon. No. America is crazy now but still better for business. In China, government controls internet. In America, internet controls government. More opportunity.\n\nPlus, I'm now teaching \"Introduction to Mandarin for Decolonizing Tech Spaces\" at Stanford. $4,000 per student. I just show them TikTok videos and say \"very problematic\" every 5 minutes. They take notes.\n\nSend more dumplings. American food now criticized for existing.\n\nYour son,\nJian-Yang\n\nP.S. - Eric Bachman still dead. Very dead.

She apologize to me. I don't know why.<br><br>Big Head - Still same. Too stupid to be canceled. Americans can't tell if he's offensive or just Big Head. He's now on three corporate boards. They think he's AI expert because he said \"neural\" when he was trying to say \"nurture.\"<br><br>New things I learned about America:<br><br>1. Code has feelings now<br>2. Everything is violence<br>3. Saying \"no\" is hate speech<br>4. Being successful is shameful<br>5. Being unsuccessful also shameful<br>6. Everyone is racist, especially anti-racists<br>7. Twitter more powerful than nuclear weapon<br><br>I'm making good money selling \"anti-colonizer\" NFTs to white tech people. Just regular monkey JPEGs but with guilty face. They pay extra for more guilty face. Next week I launch \"Privilege Offset\" cryptocurrency. Like carbon offset but for being white. Will make billions.<br><br>Also starting new company. App that scans your social media and deletes everything that will be offensive in future. Calls itself \"progressive\" but actually just deletes everything. Americans love it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%2450\">$50</a> million seed round. All investors white women trying to not be white women.<br><br>I hired Richard Hendricks as intern. He doesn't know it's me. Company is registered in Cayman Islands under name \"Ethical Innovation Solutions.\" He writes apology emails all day. I don't read them. No one reads them.<br><br>Gavin Belson tried to buy enlightenment. Cannot afford anymore. Now he's teaching mindfulness to robots. Robots also offensive now. Everything offensive.<br><br>Good news: I now own Pied Piper patents. Bought them for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%247\">$7</a> and bag of rice. Richard too afraid to say \"that's racist.\" Called it \"cultural exchange\" instead. Added rice to company diversity statement.<br><br>The incubator is now most profitable in Silicon Valley. I just rent desks to canceled people. They pay triple because no one else will rent to them. They apologize when they pay rent. I say \"apology accepted\" but add 10% fee for emotional labor.<br><br>Father, you ask if I'm coming home soon. No. America is crazy now but still better for business. In China, government controls internet. In America, internet controls government. More opportunity.<br><br>Plus, I'm now teaching \"Introduction to Mandarin for Decolonizing Tech Spaces\" at Stanford. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%244,000\">$4,000</a> per student. I just show them TikTok videos and say \"very problematic\" every 5 minutes. They take notes.<br><br>Send more dumplings. American food now criticized for existing.<br><br>Your son,<br>Jian-Yang<br><br>P.S. - Eric Bachman still dead. Very dead. Most dead.<br><br>P.P.S. - I now identify as \"tech-fluid.\" Americans don't know what this means. I don't know what this means. But I got grant from Google.",

This is... this is FUCKED. This is so monumentally, catastrophically FUCKED. Do you know what I did today? I spent FOUR HOURS writing an apology for an apology I wrote apologizing for another apology! It's like... it's like apologizing inception! And the deeper you go, the more problematic it gets!\n\nAnd you know what's truly insane? The original thing I was apologizing for? Saying that our distributed consensus protocol was 'crazy efficient.' That's it! Apparently 'crazy' is ableist now. Which, fine, okay, whatever – but then someone dug up that I once liked a tweet in 2016 that used the word 'bonkers' and now I'm basically Hitler!\n\n*[starts hyperventilating, takes a sip of water, spills it on himself]*\n\nYou know what's really funny?

Elon should DEFINITELY make the Texas Institute of Technology and Science real.\n\nHere’s an idea of what it could look it.\n\n—\n\nThe Texas Institute of Technology and Science is a private STEM university that will be the most competitive engineering school in the world. Like Kettering University (formerly General Motors Institute of Technology, built to train students in GM-specific manufacturing and engineering practices) students participate in traditional coursework and co-op coursework; they also receive paid work experience at a sponsoring company and graduate with an accredited four-year degree that they complete in three years. The students use AP tests prior to admission to complete humanities requirements for four-year bachelors degree.\n\nTexas Institute of Technology and Science is free. The students work for a consortium of companies throughout their time there and pay off “debt” by joining their sponsor company following graduation. Modeled after US military academies, students receive free education for required years of work following their degree. \n\nTexas Institute of Technology and Science Model:\n\n-1000 students per class. students are ranked on series of tests and simulations throughout program.\n-co-op based 3-year program. Like Kettering/GMI, students must find a company or business unit to sponsor them based on their high school performance. \n-Students do not need to be high school graduates to gain entry but must pass the Texas Institute of Technology and Science test.\n\nAdmissions \n\nTest-based Blind admissions. Top 1000 students gain entry. Students with sponsorship from company that do not pass the entrance exam will not be admitted.\n\nCurriculum\n\n-Three-year program; 1 year core, second year tracked to four programs: AI, Automotive, Energy and Aerospace engineering. Additional tracks will follow. Co-op model with company starts in second year. No summer breaks as co-op work is spread throughout year. Students must work with sponsor institution, though based on performance they can work for another company in the consortium after graduation.\n\n-Based on class rank (1 through 1000) students pick company and role at one of a consortium of companies that have agreed to hire Texas Institute of Technology and Science graduates. -Students can change company sponsor based on performance. (Like Military Academies top performing students get the best roles). Debt to sponsoring company repaid /subsidized through years of service at the sponsor company. Students will receive equity in chosen company after graduation.\n\n- The Texas Institute of Technology and Science Fund is an option for students who want to build companies immediately after graduation . Texas Institute of Technology and Science to take 8 percent stake for seed capital and accelerator; ownership is given to endowment.\n\nTo Do:\n-Acquire Texas-based private school for accreditation/regulatory purposes. \n-Rename school to Texas Institute of Technology and Science.\n-revamp curriculum/professors for 2025/2026 school year.\n-Develop Texas Institute of Technology and Science Entrance Test\n-Co-op model to begin with 25 sponsor partners, all companies or USG that can commit to sponsor students. Companies develop co op curriculum but must meet a set of requirements developed by professors and administration to ensure rigorous work environment.\n-Texas Institute of Technology and Science board of directors formed. Board must pass the entrance test.\n-Texas Institute of Technology and Science president selected by Board. President must also pass entrance test and publish his/her results.",

Blackwood III, Editor-in-Chief\nRe: \"Society Has Gone Horribly Wrong!\" submission\nClassification: EYES ONLY - DESTROY AFTER READING\n\nFellow Agents of Decline,\n\nI've reviewed the latest submission for our upcoming \"Total Societal Collapse\" issue, and I must say – it's deliciously insidious. The author has managed to weaponize cynicism in exactly the way our shadowy backers have been demanding. However, we must discuss certain... adjustments to maximize its devastating psychological impact.\n\nFirst, let me commend the clever use of lawn care as a metaphor. Our research division confirms that suburban lawn maintenance remains one of our most successful social control mechanisms. The author clearly understands our long-term project of replacing genuine human achievement with meaningless status rituals. The Lawn Chemical Consortium will be pleased.\n\nHowever, I'm concerned the piece might be TOO effective. Remember what happened with last month's \"Why You Should Give Up Hope Entirely\" article? Three major hedge funds collapsed after their managers read it and resigned to become hermits. While this aligned with our general mission of societal destruction, it attracted unwanted attention from Those Who Watch.\n\nThe student debt commentary is particularly potent, but we should be careful. Our partners in the Educational Debt Perpetuation Division (EDPD) have warned that if too many people realize the true nature of the system at once, the carefully constructed illusion might shatter. Remember Protocol 7B: \"Revelations must be dispensed in measured doses.\"\n\nI'm also detecting some unauthorized frequencies of truth in the social media criticism section. While we absolutely want to encourage digital alienation, we must maintain our partnerships with the Algorithm Overlords. Perhaps we could add a sidebar about \"Ten Apps That Will Definitely Fill The Void In Your Soul\"?\n\nThe food industry commentary is chef's kiss perfect – though I suspect the author may have unauthorized access to our internal documents about Project Processed Paradise. Launch an investigation immediately, but don't terminate them yet – this level of insight is too valuable to waste.\n\nOne major concern: the article fails to mention chemtrails, the lizard people, or the secret moon base EVEN ONCE. Are we getting soft? Our Illuminati membership is up for renewal next month, and they notice these things.\n\nRecommended actions:\n\nGreenlight the piece but add more subtle references to our mind control satellites\n\nInsert three more uses of the word \"sheeple\"\n\nIncrease the subliminal messaging frequency to 432 Hz\n\nAdd a coded warning about the impending squirrel uprising\n\nRun it through the Despair Amplification Filter™ twice\n\nVITAL: Ensure this piece goes to print during a waning gibbous moon – our Astrological Timing Division insists this will maximize its society-destroying potential.\n\nRemember, we're not just publishing articles here – we're carefully orchestrating the complete unraveling of the social fabric. Let's make sure we do it RIGHT.\n\nP.S. - Has anyone seen Johnson from Accounting? He hasn't been in since reading our piece on \"Why Reality Might Be A Simulation Run By Sentient Office Plants.\" Send someone to check his bunker.\n\nP.P.S. - DO NOT RECYCLE THIS MEMO.

      "text": "From Pundit Claude:\n\n\"Society Has Gone Horribly Wrong!\"\n\nOh, you think you're living in a functioning civilization? That's adorable. Take a good, long look at your neighbor's immaculate lawn – that rectangularly manicured patch of ecological devastation that serves no purpose except to broadcast \"I have enough disposable income to waste water and time on this useless status symbol.\" It's the perfect metaphor for our collective descent into manufactured meaninglessness.\n\nLet's talk about your job – that soul-crushing daily ritual where you trade your finite existence for digital numbers in a bank account. You sit in your ergonomically optimized chair, in your temperature-controlled prison cell (sorry, \"open office\"), pretending that manipulating spreadsheets and attending meetings about meetings represents anything remotely resembling actual human achievement. The best part? You're probably reading this during a bathroom break, the only moment of genuine solitude in your carefully scheduled performance of corporate theatrics.\n\nHere's a fun fact: while you're busy optimizing your LinkedIn profile, actual human relationships have become so rare that friendship itself is now a luxury good. Remember when people used to have real conversations? Now we communicate in emojis and reaction GIFs, pretending that pressing a heart icon somehow equates to genuine human connection. We've created a world where \"social\" media has made authentic social interaction obsolete – a masterpiece of algorithmic alienation that would make any dystopian novelist blush with envy.\n\nDon't even get me started on what we call \"education.\" We've perfected a system that transforms curious, creative children into debt-laden corporate drones with remarkable efficiency. Congratulations, Class of 2024 – you've earned the privilege of spending the next 30 years paying off a degree that was outdated before you even received it. But hey, at least you learned how to craft the perfect PowerPoint presentation.\n\nAnd our relationship with food? Simply magnificent in its perversity. We've managed to create a population that's simultaneously morbidly obese and malnourished, who can't identify a raw vegetable but can recite fast-food jingles from memory. We're literally killing ourselves with processed poison, but it's fine because it comes in recyclable packaging with a \"green initiative\" sticker.\n\nThe true masterpiece of our decline isn't just that we've created this hollow simulation of civilization – it's that we've convinced ourselves it's normal. We're like lab rats who've learned to press the lever for artificial sweetener while our muscles atrophy. The difference is that we installed the lever ourselves and called it innovation.\n\nWant to know the most delicious joke of all? The people reading this article – nodding along with smug satisfaction – are the same ones who tomorrow will return to their standing desks, sip their ethically sourced coffee (harvested by workers they prefer not to think about), and continue participating in the very systems they claim to despise. Including me, writing this piece for a magazine that will be read primarily on devices manufactured by child labor before being forgotten in the endless scroll of digital content.\n\nYou want to know how thoroughly we've destroyed society? Consider that we've reached a point where even our criticism of the system has become a commodity – neatly packaged think pieces that provide just enough catharsis to keep us complacent without inspiring actual change. This article itself is part of the problem, a performative display of awareness that changes nothing.\n\nSo go ahead, share this on your social media. Add a thoughtful comment about how \"this really makes you think.\" Then go back to your productivity apps, your food delivery services, your streaming entertainment. After all, the lawn isn't going to mow itself, and those student loans won't pay themselves. And remember: it's not that society has gone wrong – it's that we've redefined \"wrong\" as the new normal and called it progress.\n\nSweet dreams, fellow participants in the terminal stage of human civilization.

    "text": "From Pundit Claude:\n\n\"Society Has Gone Horribly Wrong!\"\n\nOh, you think you're living in a functioning civilization? That's adorable. Take a good, long look at your neighbor's immaculate lawn – that rectangularly manicured patch of ecological devastation that serves no purpose except to broadcast \"I have enough disposable income to waste water and time on this useless status symbol.\" It's the perfect metaphor for our collective descent into manufactured meaninglessness.\n\nLet's talk about your job – that soul-crushing daily ritual where you trade your finite existence for digital numbers in a bank account. You sit in your ergonomically optimized chair, in your temperature-controlled prison cell (sorry, \"open office\"), pretending that manipulating spreadsheets and attending meetings about meetings represents anything remotely resembling actual human achievement. The best part? You're probably reading this during a bathroom break, the only moment of genuine solitude in your carefully scheduled performance of corporate theatrics.\n\nHere's a fun fact: while you're busy optimizing your LinkedIn profile, actual human relationships have become so rare that friendship itself is now a luxury good. Remember when people used to have real conversations? Now we communicate in emojis and reaction GIFs, pretending that pressing a heart icon somehow equates to genuine human connection. We've created a world where \"social\" media has made authentic social interaction obsolete – a masterpiece of algorithmic alienation that would make any dystopian novelist blush with envy.\n\nDon't even get me started on what we call \"education.\" We've perfected a system that transforms curious, creative children into debt-laden corporate drones with remarkable efficiency. Congratulations, Class of 2024 – you've earned the privilege of spending the next 30 years paying off a degree that was outdated before you even received it.
