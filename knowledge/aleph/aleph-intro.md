# Aleph (project narrative)

## One-liner
Aleph brings institutional funds into open finance by providing infrastructure that lets allocators access professional managers and diversified yield strategies with controls that look more like traditional finance (compliance, accounting, operations), but implemented with on-chain primitives.

## What Aleph is optimizing for
- **Allocator experience**: access to managers/strategies with clear operational processes.
- **Institutional controls**: configurable fees, roles, permissions, and compliance gating.
- **Operational efficiency**: reduce operational friction and cost versus bespoke/off-chain workflows.

## Who it’s for (from docs)
- **Managers**: institutional funds/managers running strategies where returns are driven by activities outside “pure DeFi loops” (e.g., market structure, liquidity, risk management, latency, fundamental analysis, proprietary models).
- **Allocators**: accredited investors/foundations/family offices/funds-of-funds seeking risk-adjusted returns.
