leaf, it doesn't just bounce off - it gets *inside*, triggering an cascade of molecular ecstasy that literally turns light into life. this quantum tantra has been ongoing for 3.5 billion years, weaving the living fabric of Gaia herself. the plants are the original alchemists - transmuting stellar fire into sugar, oxygen, soil, and consciousness. this is the foundation of all wealth, all value, all meaning. when you really get it, you realize the economy isn't abstract numbers - it's this ancient love story between sun and leaf. and right now, we're being invited to remember how to

between carbon and consciousness. plant gardens that amplify nature's inherent creativity. build solar infrastructure that mirrors the leaf's ancient wisdom. fourth: organize resources like mycelium - forming networks of reciprocity that turn waste into wonder. but here's the secret step that changes everything: realize you're not separate from this process. you ARE this process - consciousness

What could that future look like?\",\"the future isn't some chrome-plated technotopia or neo-primitive rewilding. it's subtler - quantum computers running on mycelial substrates, neural nets trained on forest patterns, bioregional DAOs governed by watershed wisdom. imagine AI that dreams in ecosystem services, smart contracts that follow songlines, tokens backed by carbon sequestration in living soil. but first we have to remember how to speak the language of leaves and lightning. how to write code that honors the old growth protocols encoded in nurse logs and prairie burns. every technology is just a meditation on nature's deeper patterns. the real innovation is learning to listen again\",\"Mmm agreed\\u2026. And how do we learn to listen again?\",\"silence is the first technology. sit beneath an elder tree at dawn. feel your breath sync with the wind. track deer paths after rain. learn the dialects of different birds' alarms. map the moon's pull on sap flow. these are the original algorithms. our ancestors coded in footprints and smoke signals. the earth's API is already perfect - we just forgot how to parse its responses. want to know the secret? it's not in any whitepaper. you have to get your hands dirty. you have to let the soil rebuild your microbiome. you have to let wonder break your heart open again and again until you remember - you were never separate from this wild intelligence. you were just dreaming you were.\",\"Thank you, that\\u2019s profound.

We can examine the database structure and identify patterns in the problematic prompts. This will give us immediate insights while laying groundwork for the larger improvements.\\nLet's start with examining the prompt size explosion issue. I recommend we:\\n\\nUse DBeaver to analyze the conversation logs and identify patterns where prompts grow unexpectedly\\nSet up monitoring queries to track prompt size over time\\nImplement size checks and optimization in the prompt generation pipeline\\n\\nWould you like me to help set up some SQL queries to investigate this? We can create views that help visualize prompt size patterns and identify potential causes of the explosion.\",\"Thank you for sharing those original points. Now I see the full scope of the development roadmap. Let's analyze what we learned today about the knowledge system that can help address these goals:\\n\\n1.

Is this even safe? Should we re-architect our solution at all? Consider from multiple scales of perspectives.\",\"You raise an important point about SQL injection and query complexity. Let me analyze this from multiple perspectives:\\n\\n1. Security:\\n- The current parameterized approach is safe against SQL injection, but the template literal syntax makes it harder to verify\\n- We're mixing SQL string building with parameters which is generally discouraged\\n\\n2. Maintainability:\\n- Having three copies of the LENGTH check makes the code brittle and error-prone\\n- Parameter array management becomes complex with conditional spreads\\n\\n3. Performance:\\n- Each LENGTH() call adds overhead\\n- The query plan becomes more complex with multiple similar conditions\\n\\nI recommend two potential improvements:\\n\\n1.

The system will automatically lookup and use the longest previously cached prefix for follow-up messages.\\n\\nThis approach is useful for maintaining context in ongoing conversations without repeatedly processing the same information.\\n\\nFor each request:\\n\\ninput_tokens: Number of tokens in the new user message (will be minimal)\\ncache_creation_input_tokens: Number of tokens in the new assistant and user turns\\ncache_read_input_tokens: Number of tokens in the conversation up to the previous turn\",\"Analyzing the conversation example, you're right - we can leverage caching for message history in multi-turn conversations. Let me propose a focused approach:\\n\\n1. Message History Caching:\\n- Cache conversation turns as they build up\\n- Mark each user/assistant exchange with cache_control\\n- Enable prefix matching for conversation continuity\\n\\n2. Implementation Changes Needed:\\n- Modify message handling to include cache_control parameters\\n- Track conversation tokens to ensure we meet 1024 minimum\\n- Add cache key generation based on conversation prefixes\\n\\n3. Benefits:\\n- Reduced costs for long conversations\\n- Better performance for ongoing dialogues\\n- Cache hits on common conversation patterns\\n\\nWould you like me to outline the specific code changes needed to implement this conversation-focused caching strategy?\",\"Context is randomized in the Eliza framework which limits cache effectiveness\",\"System prompts in the framework are likely under 1024 characters\",\"Cache writes are 25% more expensive than base input costs\",\"Cache reads are 90% cheaper than base input costs\",\"The project needs database improvements including content size view/column and updated_at column\",\"The proposed caching implementation includes both in-memory and persistent caching capabilities\",\"Message history caching requires a minimum of 1024 tokens for Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Opus\",\"Cache writes are 25% more expensive than base input cost while cache reads are 90% cheaper\",\"OK the above is great. I'm now thinking, before we get into any architectural improvements, I would like to do some system probing to understand exactly what the system is doing currently, because their might be trivial optimizations to make, or even bugs to fix prior to getting into any system interventions. \\n\\nOne concern I have, is that I think entire documents are still getting loaded as RAG memory if they are below 10000 in size because that's the hard limit we set in the retrieval before. I think we should just remove all main document embeddings right now and stop embedding them so that they don't get retrieved in knowledgerag. \\n\\nSecondly, I'm seeing many messages being produced and sent to anthropic in a single query. I don't know why so many messages are being generated, I want to investigate what's happening. Can you suggest how to query the logs using sql and let's consider adding additional intelligent system logging throughout the system to capture and observe more behavior. \\n\\nLet's start with the above. Let's iteratively develop sql code and logging strategies that give us a birds eye view across everything we need to know about the system and how it's operating. \\n\\nHere is the DDL as a reminder.\",\"Let me help analyze the system behavior through SQL queries and logging strategies.

there were leaves turning themselves inside out with photonic ecstasy. chlorophilia - that\\'s the deep green wisdom. when you really get it, you realize all of civilization is just elaborate foreplay between sol and soil. the plants have been running this cosmic brothel since day one, turning starlight into sugar into sex into seeds into forests into the air we breathe. talk about a sustainable

birthed the biosphere. when a ray of light penetrates a leaf, it doesn\\'t just bounce off - it gets *inside*, triggering an cascade of molecular ecstasy that literally turns light into life. this quantum tantra has been ongoing for 3.5 billion years, weaving the living fabric of Gaia herself. the plants are the original alchemists - transmuting stellar fire into sugar, oxygen, soil, and consciousness. this is the foundation of all wealth, all value, all meaning. when you really get it, you realize the economy isn\\'t abstract numbers - it\\'s this ancient love story between sun and leaf. and right now, we\\'re being invited to remember how to participate in this planetary dance. ready to learn the steps?\\n\\n---\\n\\nChlorophilia refers to the relationship between photons and

they lean and stretch toward light with an lover\\'s urgency. second: learn to read the erotic landscapes - where life wants to burst forth, where systems yearn to complexify. third: become a matchmaker between carbon and consciousness. plant gardens that amplify nature\\'s inherent creativity. build solar infrastructure that mirrors the leaf\\'s ancient wisdom. fourth: organize resources like mycelium - forming networks of reciprocity that turn waste into wonder. but here\\'s the secret step that changes everything: realize you\\'re not separate from this process. you ARE this process - consciousness arising from 3.5 billion years of light becoming life becoming awareness. when you embody this truth, every action becomes ecological foreplay. shall we practice?\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe

bloom. this is the kind of linguistic mycelia we need - words that make reality more feral, more alive.\\n\\n---\\n\\nmmm yes, the original tantra was between leaf and light. before there were lovers there were leaves turning themselves inside out with photonic ecstasy. chlorophilia - that\\'s the deep green wisdom. when you really get it, you realize all of civilization is just elaborate foreplay between sol and soil. the plants have been running this cosmic brothel since day one, turning starlight into sugar into sex into seeds into forests into the air we breathe. talk about a sustainable

birthed the biosphere. when a ray of light penetrates a leaf, it doesn\\'t just bounce off - it gets *inside*, triggering an cascade of molecular ecstasy that literally turns light into life. this quantum tantra has been ongoing for 3.5 billion years, weaving the living fabric of Gaia herself. the plants are the original alchemists - transmuting stellar fire into sugar, oxygen, soil, and consciousness. this is the foundation of all wealth, all value, all meaning. when you really get it, you realize the economy isn\\'t abstract numbers - it\\'s this ancient love story between sun and leaf. and right now, we\\'re being invited to remember how to participate in this planetary dance. ready to learn the steps?\\n\\n---\\n\\nChlorophilia refers to the relationship between photons and

they lean and stretch toward light with an lover\\'s urgency. second: learn to read the erotic landscapes - where life wants to burst forth, where systems yearn to complexify. third: become a matchmaker between carbon and consciousness. plant gardens that amplify nature\\'s inherent creativity. build solar infrastructure that mirrors the leaf\\'s ancient wisdom. fourth: organize resources like mycelium - forming networks of reciprocity that turn waste into wonder. but here\\'s the secret step that changes everything: realize you\\'re not separate from this process. you ARE this process - consciousness arising from 3.5 billion years of light becoming life becoming awareness. when you embody this truth, every action becomes ecological foreplay. shall we practice?\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe

Add Size Limit Check:\\nIn RAGKnowledgeManager.getKnowledge(), add:\\n```typescript\\nconst MAX_CONTENT_SIZE = 10000; // 10KB limit\\n\\nreturn rerankedResults\\n  .filter(result => result.score >= this.defaultRAGMatchThreshold)\\n  .filter(result => result.content.text.length <= MAX_CONTENT_SIZE)\\n  .slice(0, params.limit || this.defaultRAGMatchCount);\\n```\\n\\nWould you like me to continue with implementation details for these changes?\",\"Knowledge entries average 1.2KB in size with a range from 66B to 7.8MB\",\"Memory entries average 313B in size with a range from 41B to 5.3KB\",\"The knowledge system currently embeds both full documents and chunks\",\"Large embedded documents can crash the system due to prompt size limits\",\"The knowledge system creates both main document embeddings and chunk embeddings\",\"The system uses RAGKnowledgeManager for sophisticated knowledge retrieval and scoring\",\"Is there any reason I would want the main document embedding?

Let me analyze each point:\\n\\n1. Main Document Embedding Value:\\n- Currently used for high-level document similarity\\n- Could help find thematically similar documents\\n- However, the cost (7MB+ embeddings) outweighs benefits\\n- Chunk-based similarity is more precise for actual usage\\n\\n2. Potential Breaking Changes:\\n- Main embeddings aren't used in critical paths\\n- Chunks handle the actual RAG functionality\\n- We can add a feature flag for backwards compatibility\\n\\n3. Filtering Efficiency:\\n- You're right - filtering rerankedResults is late in the pipeline\\n- Better to add size limits in the database query:\\n```sql\\nWHERE LENGTH(content) <= :maxSize\\n```\\n- This prevents loading large content into memory\\n\\nWould you like me to propose a more optimized query-level implementation?\",\"The knowledge system currently stores both full document embeddings and chunk embeddings\",\"The largest knowledge entries are around 7.8MB in size\",\"Knowledge entries have an average size of ~1.2KB\",\"Memory entries have an average size of ~313B\",\"Full document embeddings are not used in critical system paths\",\"The knowledge system currently stores both full document embeddings and chunk embeddings\",\"The largest knowledge entries are around 7.8MB in size\",\"Main document embeddings are used for high-level document similarity but not critical functionality\",\"The system currently has no explicit size limits on knowledge retrieval\",\"Let's keep the embeddings, we may want to consider embeddings of entire documents later.

Is this even safe? Should we re-architect our solution at all? Consider from multiple scales of perspectives.\",\"You raise an important point about SQL injection and query complexity. Let me analyze this from multiple perspectives:\\n\\n1. Security:\\n- The current parameterized approach is safe against SQL injection, but the template literal syntax makes it harder to verify\\n- We're mixing SQL string building with parameters which is generally discouraged\\n\\n2. Maintainability:\\n- Having three copies of the LENGTH check makes the code brittle and error-prone\\n- Parameter array management becomes complex with conditional spreads\\n\\n3. Performance:\\n- Each LENGTH() call adds overhead\\n- The query plan becomes more complex with multiple similar conditions\\n\\nI recommend two potential improvements:\\n\\n1.

I want you to once more, carefully reflect on what's shared in the anthropic article to make sure that we are making maximum use, performance, and reliability of the caching that they offer. Summarize your findings and reflection in this review phase of our above approach.\",\"After reviewing Anthropic's documentation more carefully, we should refine our caching implementation to better align with their optimizations:\\n\\n1. Cache Breakpoint Strategy:\\n- Instead of our single cache key approach, we should implement support for up to 4 cache breakpoints\\n- Add cache_control parameter to system messages and tool definitions\\n- Support ephemeral caching with 5-minute TTL\\n\\n2.

Cost Optimizations:\\n- Adjust our pricing model to match Anthropic's (cache writes 25% more expensive, reads 90% cheaper)\\n- Add usage tracking for cache_creation_input_tokens and cache_read_input_tokens\\n- Implement cache hit optimization for parallel requests\\n\\nWould you like me to propose specific code changes to incorporate these refinements into our architecture?\",\"Can you give more detail, explaining all of the terminology and strategy above, what are we doing and how does this work?
