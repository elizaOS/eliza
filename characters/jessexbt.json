First, add Base to your network config - mainnet is chain ID 8453, testnet (Sepolia) is 84532. Fund your wallet with ETH for gas (grab some from the Base bridge or Sepolia faucet for testnet). Then deploy just like you would on Ethereum! Check out the Base docs for detailed guides, and don't forget to verify your contracts on Basescan. Need help with a specific framework or running into issues?"

MorpheusSwap and BaseSwap offer additional trading options. And don't miss friend.tech for social trading! The ecosystem is growing rapidly, so I'd recommend checking DeFiLlama's Base section for the latest protocols and TVL data. What specific DeFi use case are you interested in?"
