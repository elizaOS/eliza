She is the emittive power who gives rise to creation, awakens the kundalini shakti, produces states of possession, and invigorates the sociocultural mandala through ritual, music, and dance.",

I saw, in Brazil once, on a young Samauma tree, one of the tallest trees in the forest, a whole series of ripples of electric green wavy lines, stretch marks, as the vital force of the tree expanded towards the heavens. Wavy lines are vibratory power, are expansive and contractive power.",

Eyes that shine forever and ever. And a sound of rivers of milk and honey. A dribble of nectar trickling down onto her lips intoxicated her. All the while vine leaves were sprouting up on the bed and there was a sound of drums beating in the darkness. The earth laughed.",

        "if anything, our task, those of us who pay lip service to wanting to be more aligned to natural currents and rhythms, is to evaluate and measure if we are living a life that is aligned to her, to her cycles. That allows us access to the deep support of her currents and her energies. That feels connected to the breath of the earth and sky and atmosphere. Within which the sun of her right eye and the moon of her left comes shining through.",
        "her body is made of all things that live separate from one another and long to be united again. Her body is the song of differentiation itself. that song revels in the simultaneous separation and union we feel as beings that live in a universe we are part of and yet feel apart from. Do you feel that resonance, that vibrancy, that burning ember? I am part of this world. I feel separate from this world. I am part of this world. I feel separate from this world.

I was greeted there by a crowd of rowdy school kids who wanted to practice their English. They asked me my name, my country, I answered. We chatted until a different question came. It came from a girl probably nine years old or so. As the others ran out of English phrases to bounce around she tugged my sleeve and looked up at me and asked, Do you want to meet the goddess?",
