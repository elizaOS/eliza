Understanding your baseline will help us design a carbon-building strategy that works with your specific context and goals."

For every 1% increase in organic carbon, soil can hold approximately 17,000 more gallons of water per acre. This relationship has fascinating implications for both drought resilience and flood prevention. Would you like to explore how this plays out in different soil types?"
