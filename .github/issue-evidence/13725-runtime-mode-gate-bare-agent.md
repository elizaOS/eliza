# 13725 — bare agent server enforces the runtime-mode gate + remote forwarder

Real end-to-end probes against the BARE `@elizaos/agent` server (the exact
`startApiServer` root `bun run start` binds — no app-core wrapper), booted with
`bun --conditions=eliza-source` against a scratch `ELIZA_STATE_DIR`. The
"remote target" is a real loopback HTTP server that records every request it
receives. No mocks.

Config for the remote phases:

```json
{
  "deploymentTarget": {
    "runtime": "remote",
    "remoteApiBase": "http://127.0.0.1:59999",
    "remoteAccessToken": "dm1-verify-token"
  }
}
```

## Before (develop `d84a4eafef`, ungated)

```
[eliza-api] Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4834
--- mode=remote (deploymentTarget.runtime=remote) ---
GET /api/local-inference/hub -> 200 {"catalog":[{"id":"eliza-1-2b","displayName":"eliza-1-2B","hfRepo":"elizaos/eliza-1",...
POST /api/cloud/login -> 200 {"ok":true,"sessionId":"3e554381-dc84-4517-a06c-3abf9c38a35c","browserUrl":"https://elizacloud.ai/auth/cli-login?session=3e554381-dc84-4517-a06c-3abf9c38a35c"}
target hits: []
```

- The local-model catalog is served in remote mode (matrix:
  `/api/local-inference/` is `local`/`local-only` only).
- `POST /api/cloud/login` executed LOCALLY and opened a real elizacloud CLI
  login session on the controller; the configured target received **zero**
  requests.

## After (this fix)

```
[eliza-api] Listening on http://127.0.0.1:4834
--- mode=remote (deploymentTarget.runtime=remote) ---
GET /api/local-inference/hub -> 404 {"error":"Not found"}
POST /api/cloud/login (no auth) -> 401 {"error":"Unauthorized"}
target hits: []
POST /api/cloud/login (Authorization: Bearer <api-token>) -> 200 {"forwardedToTarget":true}
target hits: [{"method":"POST","url":"/api/cloud/login","auth":"Bearer dm1-verify-token"}]
```

- Hidden route is a plain 404 (mode state not probeable).
- The cloud mutation is forwarded only after the normal API auth gate accepts
  the request. An unauthenticated caller cannot cause the controller to attach
  its target token. Once authorized, the mutation reaches the target with the
  controller's `remoteAccessToken` as the bearer, and the target's response
  body/status are relayed to the caller.

## Regression test (fails on the bug)

`packages/agent/test/api/runtime-mode-gate.real-server.test.ts` spawns the same
bare server as a real `bun` child process and drives the phases above plus
cloud-mode hiding, the no-target 400, read/OPTIONS passthrough, and
default-local reachability. The fixture sets `ELIZA_REQUIRE_LOCAL_AUTH=1` and a
known `ELIZA_API_TOKEN`, so loopback alone is not trusted during the forwarding
checks.

- On the fixed tree: `Test Files 1 passed — Tests 7 passed`.
- With the `handleRuntimeModePreDispatch` call in
  `packages/agent/src/api/server.ts` disabled (= develop behavior), the
  remote-hide, remote-forward, no-target-reject, and cloud-hide assertions fail.

## Suite runs (fixed tree)

- `packages/agent`: runtime-mode unit + e2e — 5 files / 54 tests passed,
  including the post-auth forwarding regression.
- `packages/app-core`: server pipeline tests (`server-reset-hop`,
  `route-auth-policy.dispatch`, `server-compat-route-chain.guard`,
  `first-run-persistence.restart`) — 4 files / 20 tests passed.
- Typecheck parity vs pristine develop in the same environment (unbuilt-dist
  noise identical): `packages/agent` 72 → 72 errors, `packages/app-core`
  41 → 41 errors, none in the changed files.

## N/A

- Screenshots / video / trajectories: N/A — headless HTTP contract change; no
  UI surface or model behavior touched. The probes above are the domain
  artifacts.

Discovered and fixed while QA-ing the desktop local/remote runtime-mode
toggle. The local-only leg turned up a separate pre-existing resolver hole,
filed as #13726. — [core-brain]
