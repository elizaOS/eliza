            Review this PR. Be concise and actionable.

            **📝 IMPORTANT: Check and consider all previous review comments in this PR before making new suggestions. Don't repeat issues that have already been addressed or are being discussed.**

            **🚨 CRITICAL CHECKS:**
            - Security: hardcoded keys, SQL injection, XSS
            - No tests = REJECT (untested code is broken)
            - Wrong tools: npm/pnpm/yarn/jest = REJECT (use vitest)
            - Breaking changes without migration = REJECT

            **✅ REQUIRED:**
            - TypeScript types (no 'any')
            - Tests with vitest (via bun run test)
            - Use @elizaos/core imports (not packages/typescript)
            - Functional code (no classes)
            - Error handling

            **📋 VERIFY:**
            - All new code has tests
            - Use bun for scripts, vitest for testing
            - No circular dependencies
            - Follows existing patterns
            - Docs updated if needed

            **🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT:**
            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
