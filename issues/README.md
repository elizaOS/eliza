# Documentation Issues & Improvement Plan

This directory contains organized GitHub issues for improving the ElizaOS documentation based on a comprehensive analysis of discrepancies between documentation and actual implementation.

## 📊 Analysis Summary

After cross-referencing documentation with source code, we found:
- **50%+ of CLI commands** are undocumented
- **Action interface discrepancies** with non-existent fields
- **Node.js version conflicts** across different files
- **Character file format inconsistencies** with 3 different formats
- **Project structure mismatches** between docs and templates

## 🗂️ Milestone Structure

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
- `milestone-1.1-installation-setup/` - Fix installation and setup issues that block users
- `milestone-1.2-cli-commands/` - Document missing CLI commands and fix syntax errors

### Phase 2: Code Accuracy (Week 2)  
- `milestone-2.1-action-system/` - Fix Action interface and code examples
- `milestone-2.2-character-files/` - Standardize character file documentation

### Phase 3: Enhanced Readability (Week 3)
- `milestone-3.1-code-examples/` - Add imports and file references to all examples
- `milestone-3.2-cross-references/` - Link documentation to source code

### Phase 4: Maintainability (Week 4)
- `milestone-4.1-automation/` - Automated validation and consistency checks
- `milestone-4.2-structure/` - Reorganize and improve navigation

## 🎯 Priority Levels

- **🔥 Critical**: Blocks user setup or causes confusion
- **⚠️ High**: Missing important features or incorrect information  
- **📝 Medium**: Improvements to clarity and usability
- **🔧 Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements

## 📋 Issue Templates

Each milestone contains:
- Individual issue files with GitHub issue markdown format
- Detailed problem descriptions with file references
- Acceptance criteria and implementation steps
- Code examples and expected outcomes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Review milestone folders in priority order
2. Each issue file is ready to copy-paste into GitHub Issues
3. Assign issues based on expertise areas
4. Use the acceptance criteria to validate completion
